Any joint tenant of any interest in real property shall vote as if each such tenant owned an equal fractional share of such real property. A corporation shall have its vote cast by the chief executive officer of such corporation, or such officer's designee. Any entity that is not a corporation shall have its vote cast by a person authorized by such entity to cast its vote. No owner shall have more than one vote.
(2) No holder of record of an interest in real property shall be precluded from participating in any district meeting or referendum because of the form of entity that holds such interest, whether such holder of record is (A) a corporation, partnership, unincorporated association, trustee, fiduciary, guardian, conservator or other form of entity, or any combination thereof, or (B) an individual who holds interests jointly or in common with another individual or individuals, or with any one or more of the entities listed in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision.
(e) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, including sections 7-324 to 7-329, inclusive, of the general statutes, the district shall have the power to assess, levy and collect benefit assessments upon the land and buildings in the district that, in its judgment, are benefited by the improvements.
(f) (1) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, including sections 7-324 to 7-329, inclusive, of the general statutes, the district shall have the power to fix, revise, charge, collect, abate and forgive reasonable taxes, fees, rents and benefit assessments, and other charges for the cost of the improvements, financing costs, operating expenses and other services and commodities furnished or supplied to the real property in the district in accordance with the applicable provisions of the general statutes that apply to districts established under section 7-325 of the general statutes and this section and in the manner prescribed by the district. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, the district may make grants for or pay the entire cost of any improvements, including the costs of financing such improvements, capitalized interest and the funding of any reserve funds necessary to secure such financing or the debt service of bonds or notes issued to finance such costs, from taxes, fees, rents, benefit assessments or other revenues and may assess, levy and collect such taxes, fees, rents or benefit assessments concurrently with the issuance of bonds, notes or other obligations to finance such improvements based on the estimated cost of the improvements prior to the acquisition or construction of the improvements or upon the completion or acquisition of the improvements.
(2) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, whenever the district constructs, improves, extends, equips, rehabilitates, repairs, acquires or provides a grant for any improvements or finances the cost of such improvements, such proportion of the cost or estimated cost of the improvements and financing thereof as determined by the district may be assessed by the district, referred to in this section as "benefit assessments", in the manner prescribed by such district, upon the property benefited by such improvements and the balance of such costs shall be paid from the general funds of the district. The district may provide for the payment of such benefit assessments in annual installments, not exceeding thirty, and may forgive such benefit assessments in any single year without causing the remainder of installments of benefit assessments to be forgiven. Benefit assessments to buildings or structures constructed or expanded after the initial benefit assessment may be assessed as if the new or expanded buildings or structures had existed at the time of the original benefit assessment.
(3) In order to provide for the collection and enforcement of its taxes, fees, rents, benefit assessments and other charges, the district is hereby granted all the powers and privileges with respect thereto as districts organized pursuant to section 7-325 of the general statutes, and as held by the city of Stamford or as otherwise provided in this section. Such taxes, fees, rents or benefit assessments, if not paid when due, shall constitute a lien upon the premises served and a charge against the owners thereof, which lien and charge shall bear interest at the same rate as delinquent property taxes. Each such lien may be continued, recorded and released in the manner provided for property tax liens and shall take precedence over all other liens or encumbrances except a lien for taxes of the city of Stamford. Each such lien may be continued, recorded and released in the manner provided for property tax liens.
(4) The budget, taxes, fees, rents, benefit assessments and any other charges of the district of general application shall be adopted and revised by the board of directors at least annually not more than thirty days before the beginning of the fiscal year, in accordance with the procedures to be established by the board, at a meeting called by the board, assuring that interested persons are afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard. The board shall hold at least two public hearings on its schedule of fees, rates, rents, benefit assessments and other charges or any revision thereof before adoption, notice of which shall be delivered to the mayor and board of representatives of the city of Stamford and be published in at least two newspapers of general circulation in the city of Stamford at least ten days in advance of the hearing. Not later than the date of the publication, the board of directors shall make available to the public and deliver to the mayor and the board of representatives of the city of Stamford the proposed schedule of fees, rates, rents, benefit assessments and other charges. The public hearing and appeal procedures provided by section 7-250 of the general statutes shall apply for all benefit assessments made by the district, except that the board of directors shall be substituted for the water pollution control authority. Should the benefit assessments be assessed and levied prior to the acquisition or construction of the improvements, then the amount of the benefit assessments shall be adjusted to reflect the actual cost of the improvements, including all financing costs, once the improvements have been completed, should the actual cost be greater than or less than the estimated costs. Benefit assessments shall be due and payable at such times as are fixed by the board of directors, provided the district shall give notice of such due date not less than thirty days prior to such due date by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city of Stamford and by mailing such notice to the owners of the property assessed at their last-known address.
(g) (1) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, including sections 7-324 to 7-329, inclusive, of the general statutes, whenever the district has authorized the acquisition or construction of the improvements or has made an appropriation therefor, the district may authorize the issuance of (A) up to two hundred fifty million dollars of bonds, notes or other obligations, which may be secured as to both principal and interest by (i) the full faith and credit of the district, (ii) fees, revenues or benefit assessments, or (iii) a combination of clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, (B) bonds, notes or obligations exclusively secured as to both principal and interest by fees, revenues, benefit assessments or charges imposed by the district in relation to the property financed by the bonds, notes or obligations, and (C) bonds, notes or obligations to refund outstanding bonds, notes or obligations of the district. All such bonds shall be issued to finance or refinance the cost of the improvements, the creation and maintenance of reserves required to sell the bonds and the cost of issuance of the bonds, provided no bonds shall be issued prior to the district entering into an interlocal agreement with the city of Stamford, in accordance with the procedures provided by section 7-339c of the general statutes, including at least one public hearing on the proposed agreement and ratification by the board of representatives of the city of Stamford. Such bonds shall be authorized by resolution of the board of directors. The district is authorized to secure such bonds by the full faith and credit of the district or by a pledge of or lien on all or part of its fees, revenues, benefit assessments or charges. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at the rates and shall mature at the time or times not exceeding thirty years from their date or dates, as determined by the board of directors of the district, and may be redeemable before maturity, at the option of said board, at the price or prices and under the terms and conditions fixed by said board before the issuance of the bonds. The board of directors shall determine the form of the bonds and the manner of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the denomination of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within the state of Connecticut and other locations as designated by said board. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds, the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if the officer had remained in office until the delivery.
(2) While any bonds issued by the district remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of the district shall not be diminished or impaired in any way that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of the bonds. Bonds issued under this section, unless otherwise authorized by law, shall not be considered to constitute a debt of the state of Connecticut or the city of Stamford, or a pledge of the full faith and credit of the state of Connecticut or the city of Stamford, but the bonds shall be payable solely by the district or as special obligations payable from particular district revenues, benefit assessments or charges. Any bonds issued by the district shall contain on their face a statement to the effect that neither the state of Connecticut nor the city of Stamford shall be obliged to pay the principal of or the interest thereon, and that neither the full faith and credit or taxing power of the state of Connecticut or the city of Stamford is pledged to the payment of the bonds. All bonds issued under this section shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments, as provided in title 42a of the general statutes.
(h) (1) The board of directors may authorize that the bonds be secured by a trust agreement by and between the district and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within the state of Connecticut. The trust agreement may pledge or assign the revenues, benefit assessments or charges. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of bonds or the trust agreement may contain covenants or provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be necessary, reasonable or appropriate and not in violation of law.
(2) All expenses incurred in carrying out the trust agreement may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the district. The pledge by any trust agreement or resolution shall be valid and binding from time to time when the pledge is made; the revenues or other moneys so pledged and then held or thereafter received by the board of directors shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act; and the lien of the pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the board, irrespective of whether the parties have notice thereof. Notwithstanding any provision of the Uniform Commercial Code, neither this subsection, the resolution or any trust agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the board, and no filing need be made under title 42a of the general statutes.
(i) Bonds issued under this section are hereby made securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the state of Connecticut and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, trust companies, banking associations, investment companies, executors, administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control and belonging to them; and such bonds shall be securities that may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or municipal officer or any agency or political subdivision of the state of Connecticut for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds of the state of Connecticut is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.
(j) Bonds may be issued under this section without obtaining the consent of the state of Connecticut or the city of Stamford, and without any proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions or things that are specifically required thereof by this section, and the validity of and security for any bonds issued by the district shall not be affected by the existence or nonexistence of the consent or other proceedings, conditions or things.
(k) The district and all its receipts, revenues, income and real and personal property shall be exempt from taxation and benefit assessments and the district shall not be required to pay any tax, excise or assessment to or from the state of Connecticut or any of its political subdivisions. The principal and interest on bonds issued by the district shall be free from taxation at all times, except for estate and gift, franchise and excise taxes, imposed by the state of Connecticut or any political subdivision thereof, provided nothing in this section shall act to limit or restrict the ability of the state of Connecticut or the city of Stamford to tax the individuals and companies, or their real or personal property, or any person living or business operating within the boundaries of the district.
(l) The board shall at all times keep accounts of its receipts, expenditures, disbursements, assets and liabilities, which shall be open to inspection by a duly appointed officer or duly appointed agent of the state of Connecticut or the city of Stamford. The fiscal year of the district shall begin on July first and end on the following June thirtieth or as otherwise established by section 7-327 of the general statutes. The district shall be subject to an audit of its accounts in the manner provided in the general statutes.
(m) (1) At such time as any construction or development activity financed by bonds issued by the district is taking place, the clerk of the district shall submit project activity reports quarterly to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and to the chairpersons of the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding.
(2) The district shall take affirmative steps to provide for the full disclosure of information relating to the public financing and maintenance of improvements to real property undertaken by the district. Such information shall be provided to any existing residents and to all prospective residents of the district. The district shall furnish each developer of a residential development within the district with sufficient copies of such information to provide each prospective initial purchaser of property in such district with a copy, and any developer of a residential development within the district, when required by law to provide a public offering statement, shall include a copy of such information relating to the public financing and maintenance of improvements in the public offering statement.
(n) (1) This section shall be deemed to provide an additional, alternative and complete method of accomplishing the purposes of this section and exercising the powers authorized hereby and shall be deemed and construed to be supplemental and additional to, and not in derogation of, powers conferred upon the district by law and particularly by sections 7-324 to 7-329, inclusive, of the general statutes, provided insofar as the proceedings of this section are inconsistent with any general statute or special act, or any resolution or ordinance of the city of Stamford, this section shall be controlling.
(2) Except as specifically provided in this section, all other statutes, ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations of the state of Connecticut and the city of Stamford shall be applicable to the property, residents and businesses located in the district. Nothing in this section shall in any way obligate the city of Stamford to pay any costs for the acquisition, construction, equipping or operation and administration of the improvements located within the district or to pledge any money or taxes to pay debt service on bonds issued by the district except as may be agreed to in any interlocal agreements executed by the city of Stamford and the district.
