The school or district improvement officer shall be an individual (1) with a demonstrated record of success in improving low performing schools or the academic performance of disadvantaged students, and (2) who is properly certified as a superintendent pursuant to chapter 166 of the general statutes or is granted a waiver in accordance with the provisions of section 10-157 of the general statutes. The school or district improvement officer shall (A) have full managerial and operational control over the low achieving school or educational reform district to implement the improvement plan, described in subparagraph (H) of subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of section 10-223e of the general statutes, as amended by this act, (B) work collaboratively with the local or regional board of education to implement the provisions of the improvement plan, and (C) be responsible for meeting the goals of the improvement plan. The improvement plan may include, but need not be limited to, any of the actions described in subparagraphs (A), (C) to (F), inclusive, (I), (J), (L) and (M) of subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of section 10-223e of the general statutes, as amended by this act. The Commissioner of Education shall settle any disputes between the school or district improvement officer and the local or regional board of education relating to the implementation of the improvement plan. The school or district improvement officer shall submit a written report to the State Board of Education and the local or regional board of education on a quarterly basis to provide information regarding the progress of the implementation of the improvement plan.
(b) (1) The Commissioner of Education shall annually evaluate each low achieving school or educational reform district for which a school or district improvement officer has been appointed to determine if the low achieving school or educational reform district has met the goals of the improvement plan and to assess the implementation of the improvement plan. The commissioner shall submit a written report of such evaluation to the State Board of Education, the district improvement officer and the local or regional board of education.
(2) If, after conducting an annual evaluation, the commissioner determines that the low achieving school or educational reform district has not met one or more goals of the improvement plan, the commissioner may require the school or district improvement officer to modify the improvement plan. If the commissioner determines that the low achieving school or educational reform district has substantially failed to meet multiple goals in the improvement plan, the commissioner may terminate the contract of the school or district improvement officer.
(3) Upon expiration of the contract of the school or district improvement officer, the commissioner shall conduct a review of the low achieving school or educational reform district to determine if the low achieving school or educational reform district has improved sufficiently, requires additional improvement or has failed to improve. If the commissioner determines that the low achieving school or educational reform district has improved sufficiently or requires additional improvement, the commissioner may renew the contract of the school or district improvement officer for an additional period not to exceed three years or return full managerial and operational control over the low achieving school or educational reform district to the local or regional board of education.
