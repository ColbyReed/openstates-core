(2) Any public agency that receives a request for a record subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, where such request: (A) Specifically names a person who has requested that his or her date of birth be kept confidential under subdivision (1) of this subsection, shall make a copy of the record requested to be disclosed and shall redact the copy to remove such person's date of birth prior to disclosing such record, (B) is for an existing list that is derived from a readily accessible electronic database, shall make a reasonable effort to redact the date of birth of any person who has requested that his or her date of birth be kept confidential under subdivision (1) of this subsection prior to the release of such list, or (C) is for any list that the public agency voluntarily creates in response to a request for disclosure, shall make a reasonable effort to redact the date of birth of any person who has requested that his or her date of birth be kept confidential under subdivision (1) of this subsection prior to the release of such list.
(3) Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, a public agency may disclose the date of birth of any person listed in subsection (a) of this section from any record that is not subject to subparagraph (A), (B) or (C) of subdivision (2) of this subsection.
(c) The provisions of this section shall not apply to Department of Motor Vehicles records described in section 14-10 of the general statutes and shall not be construed to prohibit the disclosure without redaction of any lists prepared under title 9 of the general statutes.
(d) No public agency or public official or employee of a public agency shall be penalized for violating a provision of this section, unless such violation is wilful and knowing. Any complaint of such a violation shall be made to the Freedom of Information Commission. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the commission shall serve upon the public agency, official or employee, as the case may be, by certified or registered mail, a copy of the complaint. The commission shall provide the public agency, official or employee with an opportunity to be heard at a hearing conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 of the general statutes, unless the commission, upon motion of the public agency, official or employee or upon motion of the commission, dismisses the complaint without a hearing if it finds, after examining the complaint and construing all allegations most favorably to the complainant, that the public agency, official or employee has not wilfully and knowingly violated a provision of this section. If the commission finds that the public agency, official or employee wilfully and knowingly violated a provision of this section, the commission may impose against such public agency, official or employee a civil penalty of not less than twenty dollars nor more than one thousand dollars. Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a private right of action against a public agency, public official or employee of a public agency.
