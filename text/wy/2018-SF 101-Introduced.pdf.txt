Preservation Act undermines the rights of private property
owners, inhibits economic activity critical to the state of
Wyoming    and    suppresses     revenue         to    the     state,    local   and
federal    governments.        The    legislature          further      finds    that
these negative effects can be limited if a federal agency
refrains    from    imposing     any       delay      or   restriction      on   any
federal funding, approval or permit based on any indirect
effect,     setting      requirement,            viewshed       requirement        or
similar requirement on private property within a project's
area of potential effects.
Section     2.   This    act    is    effective         immediately       upon
completion of all acts necessary for a bill to become law
as     provided    by   Article       4,    Section        8    of   the   Wyoming
Constitution.
