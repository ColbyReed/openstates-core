18LSO-0484
AN ACT relating to the administration of government; making
legislative    findings       regarding       the    federal   government's
implementation of the National Historic Preservation Act;
and providing for an effective date.
Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Wyoming:
Section 1.    W.S. 9-14-102 by creating a new subsection
(d) is amended to read:
9-14-102.    Federal          agency         actions;         findings;
challenges.
(d)   The   legislature       finds    that    while    the   National
Historic     Preservation      Act    is     vital    to   preserving     our
SF0101
STATE OF WYOMING                          18LSO-0484
history,    the    federal     government's       implementation          of     the
National Historic Preservation Act can undermine the rights
of     private    property     owners,       inhibit       economic      activity
critical to the state of Wyoming and suppress revenue to
the state, local and federal governments. The legislature
further finds that these negative effects can be limited if
a    federal     agency    refrains       from   imposing        any    delay    or
restriction on a permit based on any viewshed or similar
requirement on private property.
Section    2.    This   act    is    effective       immediately         upon
completion of all acts necessary for a bill to become law
as     provided    by     Article    4,    Section     8    of    the    Wyoming
Constitution.
