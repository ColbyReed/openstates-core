21-13-309. Determination of amount to       be
included in foundation program for each district.
(m) In    determining the   amount  to   be
included in the foundation program for each district,
the state superintendent shall:
(iv) Based upon reports from each district
on schools operating within that district for the
current school year and on grade configurations
contained within each reported school during that
school year, compute the average daily membership
(ADM) for each reported school and each grade within
each reported school in accordance with identified
grade configurations subject to the following:
(A) Effective school years 2018-2019 and
2019-2020 only, the ADM for each reported school shall
be computed based upon the schoolâ€™s ADM for the
previous school year. Effective school year 2020-2021
and each school year thereafter, the ADM for each
reported school shall be computed based upon the
average of the school's ADM counts completed at the
end of the three (3) immediately preceding school
years or the school's ADM for the previous school
year, whichever is greater;
(v) Based     upon   ADM    computations  and
identified school configurations within each district
pursuant to paragraph (iv) of this subsection, compute
the foundation program amount for each district as
prescribed by the education resource block grant model
adopted by the Wyoming legislature as defined under
W.S.   21-13-101(a)(xiv),   as   contained   within the
spreadsheets and accompanying reports referenced under
W.S. 21-13-101(a)(xvii). The following criteria shall
be   used   by   the   state   superintendent    in the
administration of the education resource block grant
model:
(F) Amounts provided within the model for
health insurance shall be based upon:
(I) Effective school years 2018-2019
and 2019-2020 only, a reimbursement basis only for
individuals actually employed by the district and paid
with funds received pursuant to the foundation program
amount under subsection (p) of this section. Amounts
reimbursed for each employee shall not exceed the
amounts in subdivision (III) of this subparagraph, as
applied to the coverage of each district employee
participating in district health insurance plans;
(I) (II) Effective school year 2020-
2021 and each school year thereafter, prior year
statewide    average    district    weighted    actual
participation in district health insurance plans as to
the proportion of employee only, split contracts,
employee plus spouse or children and family coverage;
and
(II) (III) The     annualized     state
contribution rate as of January 1 of the preceding
school year, on behalf of each employee and official
enrolled in the state group health insurance plan, for
employee only, split contracts, employee plus spouse
or children and family coverage.
(H) An amount for retirement benefits shall
be calculated on a reimbursement basis only for
individuals actually employed by the district and paid
with funds received pursuant to the foundation program
amount under subsection (p) of this section based upon
the number of district employees and the prior year
actual contributions to the Wyoming retirement system.
The   amount  per   employee  shall  not   exceed  the
percentage of the employee's salary paid by the
employer under W.S. 9-3-412(c)(iii) for the employee
portion of the contribution plus an amount not to
exceed the percentage of the employee's salary paid by
the employee provided under W.S. 9-3-413 for the
employer portion of the contribution. This paragraph
shall be repealed July 1, 2020.
(vii)    For purposes of determining the
foundation program amount for a district and not
including any alternative school authorized under W.S.
21-13-309(m)(v)(B), calculate any school facility that
contains more than one (1) school as if that school
facility contains only one (1) school, comprised of
each of the schools contained in that school facility.
This paragraph shall be repealed July 1, 2020.
21-13-313. Distribution   of     funds  from
foundation account; property tax    and   cash reserve
adjustment; regulations.
(e) Not later than January 31 of each
fiscal year, the department shall compute the amount
by which each district's operating balance and cash
reserves at the end of the preceding fiscal year
exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the total foundation
program amount computed under W.S. 21-13-309 for the
preceding fiscal year. In making this calculation, the
entire operating balance and cash reserves for each
district for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1997, as
computed by the department, shall be separately
accounted for and excluded, until it has been
completely expended by the district. Revenues from
settlements of protested amounts attributable to
levies assessed under W.S. 21-13-102(a)(i)(A) and
(ii)(A) and 21-13-201, regardless of the assessment
year, shall be accounted for and excluded from the
calculation under this subsection for a period of not
more than one (1) year following that fiscal year in
which the revenue was received by a district, as
verified in writing by the district and certified by
the county treasurer. Except as otherwise provided in
1997 Special Session Laws, chapter 3, section 306(e),
as amended, and except as excluded under this
subsection, that excess shall be deemed to be a state
revenue under W.S. 21-13-310(a) for the purpose of
determining distributions under W.S. 21-13-311 and
amounts to be rebated under W.S. 21-13-102.             The
department shall promulgate rules, including reporting
requirements    and   procedures    for     districts,   to
implement this subsection.     As used in this section,
"operating balance and cash reserves" means those
financial resources of the district which are not
encumbered by the district board of trustees for
expenditure to meet an existing legal obligation or
otherwise   restricted    by  law    or    regulation   for
expenditure on specific educational programs and for
school years 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 only, shall
include any monies within a capital improvements
reserve fund established pursuant to W.S. 16-4-105(b)
or special reserve fund established pursuant to W.S.
21-13-504.     For purposes of this subsection, any
balance    within   a    district's     separate    account
established under W.S. 21-15-109(e) for major building
and facility repair and replacement shall be deemed
restricted by law for expenditure as provided by W.S.
21-15-109(e) and shall not be considered an operating
balance and cash reserve under this section.

309(m)(v)(H). Effective school year 2020-2021 and each
school year thereafter, district expenditures computed
under subsection (b) of this section shall not include
expenditures for employee contributions to the Wyoming
retirement system exceeding five and fifty-seven
hundredths percent (5.57%) of any member employee's
salary.   In  addition,   the   department    shall,   in
accordance with procedures prescribed by department
rule and regulation, establish a base price for each
school bus type or other student transportation
vehicle type for the applicable fiscal period that
complies with minimum state standards for vehicle
specifications and equipment.      The department shall
also establish a process including competitive bidding
which guarantees the acquisition of school buses and
other student transportation vehicles approved for
reimbursement   and   complying    with   state   minimum
standards and district fleet size restrictions at the
established base price for the applicable fiscal year.
In addition and for purposes of reimbursement under
subsection (g) of this section, the department shall
in   consultation   with    the   pupil    transportation
committee, establish a minimum, average and optimal
replacement schedule for each school bus type or other
student transportation vehicle type. School districts

student transportation vehicle needs and requirements
for the appropriate fiscal year in the manner and
within the times prescribed by department rule and

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this appropriation
shall not be transferred or expended for any other purpose and
any   unexpended,   unobligated   funds   remaining    from    this
appropriation shall revert to the school foundation program
account on June 30, 2020. No school district that is held
harmless under subsection (d) of this section for a school year

final findings and recommendations to the joint education
interim committee. The department shall use the recommendations
of the legislature's 2017 recalibration consultant to guide its
