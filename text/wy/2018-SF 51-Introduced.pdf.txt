motion, hold a hearing to determine whether the evidence
presented    to     the    council   demonstrates        that   the    facility
should be permitted under this act.
(e)   The council shall find that a facility should be
permitted under this act if the evidence demonstrates that:
(i)    Reasonably foreseeable future phases of the
planned or existing facility will make the total number of
turbines greater than or equal to the threshold in W.S.
35-12-102(a)(vii)(E)(I); or
(ii)    The planned or existing installation is or
may    reasonably     be    expected      to   become    part   of    a   larger
project with other planned or existing installations owned
by separate persons and the total number of turbines in the
larger project is or will be greater than or equal to the
threshold in W.S. 35-12-102(a)(vii)(E)(I).
(f)   Within       thirty   (30)    days   from    the   date      of   the
council's finding that the facility should be permitted,
the person responsible for the planned or existing facility

(a)     As used in this chapter:
(vii)    "Industrial facility" or "facility" means
any industrial facility with an estimated construction cost
of     at    least     ninety-six      million        nine        hundred       thousand
dollars       ($96,900,000.00)         as     of     May     30,        1987.       Exempt
activities       shall       not    be      included         in        the     estimated
construction cost of an industrial facility.                                 The council
shall       adjust    this   amount,     up    or     down,       each       year   using
recognized       construction        cost          indices        as     the     council
determines       to     be   relevant         to     the     actual          change    in
construction         cost    applicable        to     the     general           type    of
construction covered under this chapter.                           "Facility" also
includes, regardless of construction cost:

electricity   from    wind    and   associated     collector      systems
that:
(I)     Consists    of   thirty     (30)   or   more
wind turbines in all planned phases of the installation; or
(II)    Expand     an    existing    installation
not previously defined as a facility to include a total
number of turbines greater than or equal to the thresholds
threshold in subdivision (a)(vii)(E)(I) of this section;.
or
(III)    Has      been    determined       by   the
council to require permitting under this act as provided in
