submission to the electors of the State of Wyoming at the

SJ0007
STATE   OF   WYOMING                     17LSO-0127
Article       15,   Section           7.    Depositories         for   public
moneys.
All money belonging to the state or to any county, city,
town,     village     or   other       subdivision           therein,    except   as
herein otherwise provided, shall, whenever practicable, be
deposited in a national bank or banks or in a bank or banks
incorporated under the laws of this state; provided, that
the bank or banks in which such money is deposited shall
furnish security to be approved as provided by law; and
provided further, that such bank or banks shall pay the
same rate of interest on any money so deposited therein on
time    certificates       of    deposit          by   the   legal   custodian    or
custodians of any such public moneys as such bank or banks
pay on time certificates of deposit of private depositors,
and the custodian or custodians of any such public moneys
shall be authorized to deposit same under time certificates
of deposit as may be provided by law. Such interest shall
accrue    to   the    fund      from    which          it   is   derived.     Moneys
belonging to the state may be deposited in federal credit
unions in this state provided that the federal credit union
pays a higher rate of interest on funds deposited therein
than banks at the time of deposit as provided by law.                             The
SJ0007
STATE   OF   WYOMING                17LSO-0127
legislature    shall      prescribe            by     law   the      allowable
differences in rates of interest paid by a federal credit
union as compared to a bank.               Such differences in rates of
interest   shall    be   in    an     amount     to   offset   the    tax   and
regulatory advantages received by federal credit unions as
compared to banks.
Section 2.    That the Secretary of State shall endorse
the following statement on the proposed amendment:
The adoption of this amendment will authorize the deposit
of state funds in federal credit unions that pay higher
rates of interest on deposits than banks as prescribed by
law.
