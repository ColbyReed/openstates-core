A    JOINT   RESOLUTION      making    an    application       to    the    United
States Congress to           call an Article V          convention of         the
several      states    for    the   purpose    of     proposing       the   state
legislatures'         pre-approved          single      issue        countermand
amendment to the United States Constitution.
WHEREAS, Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution of the
United States guarantees to every state a republican form
of government that gives each state equal standing when
calling for an Article V amendment convention; and
WHEREAS, Article V of the Constitution of the United States
reserves to the state legislatures the right to apply for
an     amendment      convention      for    the     purpose    of    proposing
amendments to the United States Constitution when Congress,
STATE   OF   WYOMING                            17LSO-0345
the courts or the executive branch refuse to address an
egregious wrong suffered by the people; and
WHEREAS, the state legislatures alone have the authority to
limit the agenda and authority of delegates and alternates
they send to an Article V convention. This authority does
not    reside   in    the       United     States         Congress,          nor       in   the
federal    or   state      courts,        nor       in    the     federal         or     state
executive branches; and
WHEREAS, Congress, under Article V of the United States
Constitution,        is        required        to     call       for        an    amendment
convention      as        directed        and        defined           by        the     state
legislatures of the several states.
NOW,    THEREFORE,        BE    IT   RESOLVED            BY    THE     MEMBERS         OF   THE
LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WYOMING:
Section 1.     That the Wyoming State Legislature hereby
applies to the United States Congress, under the provisions
of Article V of the United States Constitution, to call a
single-issue     countermand              amendment            convention          for      the
purpose    of   deciding          whether           the       pre-approved         proposed
STATE    OF   WYOMING                17LSO-0345
countermand   amendment     should       be   returned   to    the    state
legislatures for ratification.
Section 2.   That the application in section 1 of this
resolution    constitutes      a        continuing     application      in
accordance with Article V of the Constitution of the United
States until the legislatures of at least two-thirds (2/3)
of the several states have made identical or substantially
similar applications.
Section 3.   That Congress is directed to convene the
countermand   amendment   convention          within   sixty   (60)   days
from the date it receives the same or similar application
from two-thirds (2/3) of the several states.
STATE   OF   WYOMING                    17LSO-0345

transmit copies of this resolution to the President of the
United       States,     to   the    President         of   the    Senate      and   the
Speaker       of   the    House      of     Representatives         of   the    United
States Congress,           to    the Wyoming Congressional Delegation
and to the presiding officers of the legislatures of each
of     the    other      forty-nine         (49)    states,       requesting     their
cooperation with the purposes of this resolution.
