deductible or other cost-sharing requirement of a person
covered by a private health benefit plan or reduce or limit
any benefit based on this subsection.

the health status of a person covered by a private health
benefit plan; or
(ii)       Require   any    person          covered    by    a    private
health benefit plan, as a condition of issuance or renewal,
to   pay     a    premium,      deductible,            copayment,      coinsurance       or
other cost-sharing requirement based on the person's health
status     which        is    greater       than       any    premium,       deductible,
copayment,        coinsurance         or    other       cost-sharing         requirement
charged      to    another       person      covered         by   a    private      health
benefit plan who does not have a similar health status.

plan   shall       not       adjust   a     premium,         deductible,      copayment
coinsurance            or    other    cost-sharing            requirement         for   any

which may be binding on the state.
