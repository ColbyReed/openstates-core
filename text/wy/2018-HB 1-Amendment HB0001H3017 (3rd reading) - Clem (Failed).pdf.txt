"1.   (a) Of this other funds appropriation, one million six
hundred thousand dollars ($1,600,000.00) shall be expended by
the state superintendent of public instruction to establish a
pilot project for a voucher system.   These funds shall be from
that portion of the school foundation program account funded by
federal mineral royalties. The project shall:
(i)   Be administered by the state superintendent of
public instruction through the department of education;
(ii)    Operate for school years 2018-2019 and 2019-2020
only;
(iii) Be comprised of two hundred (200) public school
students who will be enrolled in grade seven (7) during the
2018-2019 school year.    The students shall be selected by the
state superintendent from applicants without regard to school
district, community or county of residence.
(b)   The two hundred (200) students selected pursuant to
subsection (a) of this footnote shall be randomly divided into
two (2) groups of one hundred (100) students subject to the
following:
(i) One (1) group of one hundred (100) students shall
be enrolled in a nonpublic school and shall receive a payment of
up to eight thousand dollars ($8,000.00) per year during the
pilot program, which shall be used to pay tuition costs assessed
by the school in which the student is enrolled. The department
of education shall enter into agreements with the parents or
guardians  of these    students to    ensure funding is     used
exclusively for tuition. The agreements shall also require that
students in this group participate during the 2018-2019 and
2019-2020 school years in the statewide assessment system for
student performance administered under W.S. 21-2-304(a)(v). Any
student within this group shall not be counted       within the
average daily membership (ADM) as computed for the    purpose of
implementing W.S. 21-13-309.  Home-based education   programs as
defined under W.S. 21-4-101(a)(v) are not eligible    under this
paragraph;
(ii)  The second group of one hundred (100) students
shall serve as a control group only and shall be counted within
the ADM of the school district in which the student resides and
attends school.
(c)   The state superintendent of public instruction shall
maintain a record of the statewide assessment system for student
performance results, administered under W.S. 21-2-304(a)(v)
during the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 school years, for the two
hundred (200) students selected under subsection (b) of this
footnote. Using the record, the superintendent shall prepare a
comparison of student performance between the two (2) groups of
one hundred (100) students as established under subsection (b)
of this section.    Information developed under this subsection
shall be used only as a basis upon which to make recommendations
to the legislature under subsection (d) of this footnote.
(d)   On or before October 1, 2019 and again on or before
October 1, 2020, the state superintendent of public instruction
shall report to the legislature on findings under this footnote
with respect to the pilot program and provide recommendations on
the future of a voucher system in Wyoming education.".
To the extent required by this amendment:   adjust totals; and
renumber as necessary. CLEM, WINTERS
