dependent thereon. Beneficial use shall be the basis, the
measure and limit of the right to use water at all times,
not exceeding the statutory limit except as provided by
W.S. 41-4-317. In addition to any beneficial use specified
by law or rule and regulation promulgated pursuant thereto,
the    use    of     water       for   the     purpose     of    extracting      heat
therefrom is considered a beneficial use subject to prior
SF0122
STATE OF WYOMING                          17LSO-0475
rights.      Water      being    always      the    property      of    the     state,
rights to its use shall attach to the land for irrigation,
or to such other purposes or object for which acquired in
accordance with the beneficial use made for which the right
receives       public       recognition,          under    the     law     and        the
administration          provided      thereby.       Water       rights    for        the
direct    use      of     the   natural   unstored        flow    of     any    stream
cannot be detached from the lands, place or purpose for
which     they      are     acquired,     except      as     provided      in     W.S.
41-3-102 and 41-3-103, pertaining to a change to preferred
use, and except as provided in W.S. 41-4-514.
(b)     The state engineer shall by rule and regulation
develop      and    maintain      a   list    of    all    beneficial          uses    as
provided in statute or determined by the state engineer.
The list of beneficial uses shall be available in print for
public inspection at the office of the state engineer and
shall     be    made      available     on    the    website       of     the    state
engineer.          Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to
affect any beneficial use determination made prior to July
