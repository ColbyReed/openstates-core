EXPLANATION
The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
This bill prohibits a person subject to the department of
transportation’s motor carrier safety rules from operating a
commercial motor vehicle while engaged in texting or while
using a hand-held mobile telephone as prohibited by federal
regulations, except in an emergency or as otherwise permitted
under such federal regulations.
A violation of the provision is a simple misdemeanor
punishable by a scheduled fine of $50 and is considered a
moving violation. However, a conviction for a violation of the
provision shall be in lieu of a conviction for a violation of
Code section 321.276 (use of electronic communication device
while driving) if the violations are based on the same facts
and circumstances. The bill also includes a violation of Code
section 321.449B on the list of traffic offenses for which
additional penalties may be imposed if the violation causes
serious injury or death. If the violation causes a serious
injury, a court could impose an additional fine of $500 or
suspend the person’s driver’s license for not more than 90
days, or both. If the violation causes a death, a court could
impose an additional fine of $1,000 or suspend the person’s
driver’s license for not more than 180 days, or both.
Under current law, a violation of Code section 321.276 is a
simple misdemeanor punishable by a scheduled fine of $30, is
not a moving violation, and is subject to the same additional
penalties if the violation causes serious injury or death.
