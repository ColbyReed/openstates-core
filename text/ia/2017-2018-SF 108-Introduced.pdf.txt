EXPLANATION
The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
This bill relates to carrying weapons including eliminating
prohibitions on possessing certain weapons.
The bill strikes the prohibition on possessing a machine
gun, a short-barreled rifle, or a short-barreled shotgun.
Under current law, a person who possesses such weapons commits
a class “D” felony. Federal law in 18 U.S.C. §922 governs
the regulation of a machine gun, short-barreled rifle, or
short-barreled shotgun.
The bill also specifies that Code chapter 724 (weapons)
shall not be construed to impose general prohibitions on
the unlicensed carrying, whether openly or concealed, of a
dangerous weapon, including a loaded firearm, if a person is
in compliance with federal law.
