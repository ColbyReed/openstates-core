An Act relating to statewide assessments of student progress
utilizing core academic indicators.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA:
Section 1. Section 256.7, subsection 21, paragraph b,
subparagraphs (2) and (3), Code 2017, are amended by striking
the subparagraphs.
EXPLANATION
The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
Current law requires that the state board of education
provide in rule for a set of core academic indicators in
mathematics and reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science
in grades 8 and 11, and that the Iowa assessments, used by
school districts in the school year beginning July 1, 2011, be
used for this purpose.
This bill strikes a requirement that the state board’s rules
provide that for the school year beginning July 1, 2017, and
each succeeding school year, all students enrolled in school
districts in grades 3 through 11 shall be administered an
assessment during the last quarter of the school year that
assesses student progress on the core academic indicators. The
requirement also provides that the assessment used after July
1, 2017, at a minimum must be aligned with the Iowa common
core standards in both content and rigor; accurately describe
student achievement and growth for purposes of the school, the
school district, and state accountability systems; and provide
valid, reliable, and fair measures of student progress toward
college or career readiness.
The bill also strikes a Code provision that requires the
director of the department of education to establish an
assessment task force to review and make recommendations
for a statewide assessment of student progress on the core
academic indicators. The Iowa assessment task force submitted
its findings and recommendations in a report to the general
assembly on December 31, 2014.
