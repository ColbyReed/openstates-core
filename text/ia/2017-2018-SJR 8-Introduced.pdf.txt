A Joint Resolution applying for an Article V convention to
propose amendments to the Constitution of the United States
that impose fiscal restraints, and limit the power and
jurisdiction of the federal government, and requesting
Congress to similarly propose such amendments.
WHEREAS, the founders of the Constitution of the United
States empowered state legislators to be guardians of liberty
against future abuses of power by the federal government; and
WHEREAS, the federal government has created a crushing
national debt through improper and imprudent spending; and
WHEREAS, the federal government has invaded the legitimate
roles of the states through the manipulative process of federal
mandates, most of which are unfunded to a great extent; and
WHEREAS, the federal government has ceased to live under
a proper interpretation of the Constitution of the United
States; and
WHEREAS, it is the solemn duty of the states to protect
the liberty of our people, particularly for the generations
to come, by proposing amendments to the Constitution of the
United States through a convention of the states under Article
V of the Constitution for the purpose of restraining these and
related abuses of power; NOW THEREFORE,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA:
That the Congress of the United States is hereby petitioned
to propose an amendment to the Constitution of the United
States, for submission to the states for ratification, to
impose fiscal restraints on the federal government and limit
the federal government’s power and jurisdiction; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That pursuant to Article V of the
Constitution of the United States, the General Assembly, as
the Legislature of the State of Iowa, makes application to
the Congress of the United States to call a convention for the
specific and exclusive purpose of proposing an amendment to
the Constitution of the United States, for submission to the
states for ratification, to impose fiscal restraints on the
federal government and limit the federal government’s power and
jurisdiction; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That pursuant to Article V of

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That it is the express intention of
the General Assembly that this application shall be aggregated

subsequent applications of other states limited to the purposes

This joint resolution provides that pursuant to Article V of

for ratification, to impose fiscal restraints on the federal
government and limit the federal government’s power and
jurisdiction.
The joint resolution additionally provides that pursuant to
Article V of the United States Constitution, the Iowa General
Assembly joins in the applications of several specified states
for a convention to impose fiscal restraints, and that the

and support of amendments that impose such restraints on the
federal government and limit the federal government’s power and
jurisdiction.
Further, the joint resolution provides that it shall serve
as a continuing application to call a constitutional convention
until at least two-thirds of the legislatures of the several
states have made application for a similar convention, or the
General Assembly acts to withdraw the application.
Finally, the joint resolution requires the Secretary
of State to transmit certified copies of the resolution
to the President and Secretary of the United States
Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House
of Representatives, the presiding officer in each house of
