An Act relating to the requirements a student must fulfill to
successfully complete a practitioner preparation program.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA:
Section 1. Section 256.16, subsection 1, paragraph a,
subparagraph (2), Code 2017, is amended to read as follows:
(2) Administer, prior to a student’s completion of the
practitioner preparation program and subject to the director’s
approval, subject assessments designed by a nationally
recognized testing service that measure pedagogy and knowledge
of at least one subject area; or, a valid and reliable
subject-area-specific, performance-based assessment for
preservice teacher candidates, centered on student learning.
A student shall not successfully complete the program unless
the student, at any time during the student’s course of study,
achieves scores above the twenty-fifth percentile nationally
on the assessments administered pursuant to this subparagraph.
In lieu of the assessment requirements of this subparagraph, a
student who is preparing to teach in a hard-to-staff subject
area as identified by the department may demonstrate mastery
of pedagogy and knowledge of subject area through a student
portfolio.
EXPLANATION
The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
This bill provides that a student who, at any time
during the student’s course of study in a practitioner
preparation program, achieves a score above the 25th percentile
nationally on a valid and reliable subject-area-specific,
performance-based assessment for preservice teacher candidates,
shall be able to use the score to complete the program even
if the department of education subsequently recalculates and
updates the passing score based on the most recent data on
scores achieved nationally on the assessment. In lieu of
the assessment requirements, the bill allows a student who
is preparing to teach in a hard-to-staff subject area as
identified by the department to demonstrate mastery of pedagogy
and knowledge of subject area through a student portfolio.
