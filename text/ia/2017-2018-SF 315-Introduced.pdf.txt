EXPLANATION
The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.
This bill relates to the identification and notification of
certain relatives of a child after an order for the removal of
the child from the custody of the child’s parent or parents in
a child in need of assistance proceeding.
Under current law, the department of human services (DHS),
juvenile court services, or a private agency, within 30 days
of an order for a child’s removal from the custody of the
child’s parent or parents, shall exercise due diligence in
identifying and providing notice to the child’s grandparents,
aunts, uncles, adult siblings, and adult relatives suggested by
the parents subject to exceptions due to the presence of family
or domestic violence. The bill amends the law to provide that
DHS, juvenile court services, or a private agency must identify
and notify such a child’s relatives within 15 days of the order
for removal.
