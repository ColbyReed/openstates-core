ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION 33
Relating to: commending the 32nd Infantry Division on its 100th anniversary.
Whereas, the 32nd Infantry Division was formed July 18, 1917, at Camp
MacArthur in Waco, Texas, and was made up of National Guard units from both
Wisconsin and Michigan; and
Whereas, over the last 100 years much has changed, including missions,
personnel, technology, and our culture, but the passion and commitment to the
profession of arms in the defense of our nation and preservation of our freedoms is
as strong today as it was in 1917; and
Whereas, the 32nd Division was comprised of 15,000 National Guardsmen from
the state of Wisconsin, the largest unit in the Wisconsin National Guard, and
designated the Red Arrow Division due to the unit shoulder patch designed to depict
a red arrow, shot through a line denoting that it pierced every battle line it ever faced;
and
Whereas, in World War I the 32nd Division fought in three major offensives,
engaging and defeating 23 German divisions with such ferocity it was described by

its French allies as “Les Terribles,” and recognized as the first combat unit to
penetrate into Germany; and
Whereas, the 32nd Division, reactivated in October 1940 for campaigns in
World War II, was among the first United States divisions to deploy as an entire unit
overseas and engage the enemy, experiencing hundreds of days of combat by the end
of the war; and
Whereas, the 32nd Division was reconstituted after World War II as a unit of
the Wisconsin National Guard and was called into federal active service in 1961 in
response to the Berlin Crisis; and
Whereas, the legacy of the 32nd Division continues as a Wisconsin National
Guard unit reorganized in 1967 as the 32nd Infantry Brigade, made up of more than
3,400 soldiers, headquartered in Camp Douglas, Wisconsin; and
Whereas, the 32nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team deployed to Iraq in 2009-10
in support of Iraqi Freedom, and its various units have all served separately in
support of the Global War on Terrorism; now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the assembly, the senate concurring, That the Wisconsin
Legislature celebrates the centennial anniversary of the establishment of the 32nd
Infantry Division and honors its service to the people of Wisconsin and the United
States of America.
