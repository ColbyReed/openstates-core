SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 88
Relating to: recognizing November 2017 as Prematurity Awareness Month.
Whereas, the March of Dimes Foundation is a pioneer in improving the health
of infants and women of childbearing age by preventing birth defects, premature
birth, and infant mortality; and
Whereas, the March of Dimes was founded by President Franklin D. Roosevelt
in 1938 to fight polio, and funded the development of two vaccines — still in use today
— that virtually eliminated the crippling disease; and
Whereas, the March of Dimes in 1958, having achieved its initial mission,
shifted its attention from polio to the prevention of birth defects, and through federal
and state advocacy led the way in establishing a nationwide network of birth defects
monitoring programs and research centers; and
Whereas, the March of Dimes has undertaken decades of groundbreaking
research in maternal and child health, which has led to the discovery of lifesaving
products and tests such as surfactant therapy for premature infants and tests to
identify life-threatening birth defects; and

Whereas, the March of Dimes was a pioneer in the support of newborn
screening, urging Congress to pass and fund the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act,
which in 2008 established national guidelines on the conditions states should
include in newborn programs, and through state advocacy ensured that every state
screens all newborns for that core set of conditions; and
Whereas, the March of Dimes actively advocated for the reauthorization of
federal funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program which covered 167,292
children in our state in 2014, ensuring vital access to pediatric healthcare services;
and
Whereas, the March of Dimes is a long-time advocate for access to health care
for women of childbearing age, infants, children, and families, ensuring they have
access to private and public health coverage under private coverage, the State
Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicaid, Title V Block Grant, and the
Affordable Care Act; and
Whereas, the March of Dimes in 2003 launched the Prematurity Campaign to
address the crisis of premature birth and help families have full-term, healthy
babies, and authored the Premature Research Expansion and Education Act for
Mothers (PREEMIE) Act, which Congress enacted in 2006, to expand research,
education, and services to fight premature births; and
Whereas, 6,124 babies are born preterm based on obstetrical estimates in the
state of Wisconsin, representing 9.2 percent of all state births; and
Whereas, the March of Dimes has set a national goal of reducing preterm births
to 5.5 percent in every state by 2030, which will result in a healthier start in life for
tens of thousands of infants; and
- 2018 Legislature               -3-                                  CMH:emw
Whereas, the March of Dimes Wisconsin Chapter has worked extensively to
promote newborn screening in the state of Wisconsin; and
Whereas, the March of Dimes Wisconsin Chapter looks forward to partnering
with the Wisconsin State Legislature in response to the continued crisis of premature
birth; and
Whereas, the month of November is recognized as World Prematurity
Awareness Month to bring about recognition of this global health crisis, and
November 17 is recognized as Prematurity Awareness Day across the United States;
and
Whereas, the March of Dimes sponsors numerous programs to support healthy
pregnancies and infants, such as its work to prevent early elective deliveries and the
NICU Family Support program; and
Whereas, the March of Dimes and its volunteers continue to advocate for
national and state health policies and programs that affect women of childbearing
age, infants, children, and families; now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the senate, the assembly concurring, That the legislature
hereby proclaims November 2017 as Prematurity Awareness Month in Wisconsin.
