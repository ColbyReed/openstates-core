(10) (title) VOLUNTARY TREATMENT OF ALCOHOLICS AND DRUG DEPENDENT PERSONS.
(a) An adult alcoholic or person who is drug dependent may apply for voluntary
treatment directly to an approved public treatment facility. If the proposed patient
is an individual adjudicated incompetent in this state who has not been deprived by
a court of the right to contract, the individual or his or her guardian or other legal
representative may make the application. If the proposed patient is an individual
adjudicated incompetent in this state who has been deprived by a court of the right
to contract, the individual's guardian or other legal representative may make the
application.
(am) Except as provided in s. 51.47, a minor may apply for treatment directly
to an approved public treatment facility, but only for those forms of treatment
specified in sub. (7) (b) 5. and 7. Section 51.13 governs admission of a minor alcoholic
or minor who is drug dependent to an inpatient treatment facility.
(c) If a patient receiving inpatient care leaves an approved public treatment
facility, the patient shall be encouraged to consent to appropriate outpatient or
intermediate treatment.     If it appears to the superintendent in charge of the
treatment facility that the patient is an alcoholic, person who is drug dependent, or
intoxicated person who requires help, the county department shall arrange for
- 2018 Legislature              - 14 -                               LRB-1910/1
assistance in obtaining supportive services and residential facilities. If the patient
is an individual who is adjudicated incompetent, the request for discharge from an
inpatient facility shall be made by a legal guardian or other legal representative or
by the individual who is adjudicated incompetent if he or she was the original
applicant.
(e) This subsection applies only to admissions of alcoholics and persons who are
drug dependent whose care and treatment is to be paid for by the department or a
county department.
(11) (title) TREATMENT    AND SERVICES FOR INTOXICATED PERSONS AND OTHERS
INCAPACITATED BY ALCOHOL OR ANOTHER DRUG.
(b) A person who appears to be incapacitated by alcohol or another drug shall
be placed under protective custody by a law enforcement officer.            The law
enforcement officer shall either bring such person to an approved public treatment
facility for emergency treatment or request a designated person to bring such person
to the facility for emergency treatment. If no approved public treatment facility is
readily available or if, in the judgment of the law enforcement officer or designated
person, the person is in need of emergency medical treatment, the law enforcement
officer or designated person upon the request of the law enforcement officer shall
take such person to an emergency medical facility. The law enforcement officer or
designated person, in detaining such person or in taking him or her to an approved
public treatment facility or emergency medical facility, is holding such person under
protective custody and shall make every reasonable effort to protect the person's
health and safety.    In placing the person under protective custody the law
enforcement officer may search such person for and seize any weapons. Placement
under protective custody under this subsection is not an arrest. No entry or other
- 2018 Legislature               - 15 -                                   TJD:amn
record shall be made to indicate that such person has been arrested or charged with
a crime. A person brought to an approved public treatment facility under this
paragraph shall be deemed to be under the protective custody of the facility upon
arrival.
(bm) If the person who appears to be incapacitated by alcohol or another drug
under par. (b) is a minor, either a law enforcement officer or a person authorized to
take a child into custody under ch. 48 or to take a juvenile into custody under ch. 938
may take the minor into custody as provided in par. (b).
(d)   A person who by examination pursuant to par. (c) is found to be
incapacitated by alcohol or another drug at the time of admission, or to have become
incapacitated at any time after admission, shall be detained at the appropriate
facility for the duration of the incapacity but may not be detained when no longer
incapacitated by alcohol or another drug, or if the person remains incapacitated by
alcohol or another drug for more than 72 hours after admission as a patient, exclusive
of Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, unless he or she is committed under sub.
(12). A person may consent to remain in the facility as long as the physician or official
in charge believes appropriate.
(12) (a) An intoxicated person who has threatened, attempted or inflicted
physical harm on himself or herself or on another and is likely to inflict such physical
harm unless committed, or a person who is incapacitated by alcohol or another drug,
may be committed to the county department and brought to an approved public
treatment facility for emergency treatment. A refusal to undergo treatment does not
constitute evidence of lack of judgment as to the need for treatment.
(c) 4. Set a time for a preliminary hearing under sub. (13) (d), such hearing to
be held not later than 48 hours after receipt of a petition under par. (b), exclusive of
- 2018 Legislature              - 16 -                                LRB-1910/1
Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. If at such time the person is unable to assist
in the defense because he or she is incapacitated by alcohol or another drug, an
extension of not more than 48 hours, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and legal
holidays, may be had upon motion of the person or the person's attorney.
(13) (a) (intro.) A person may be committed to the custody of the county
department by the circuit court upon the petition of 3 adults, at least one of whom
has personal knowledge of the conduct and condition of the person sought to be
committed. A refusal to undergo treatment shall not constitute evidence of lack of
judgment as to the need for treatment. The petition for commitment shall do all of
the following:
1. Allege that the condition of the person is such that he or she habitually lacks
self-control as to the use of alcohol beverages or other drugs, and uses such beverages
or drugs to the extent that health is substantially impaired or endangered and social
or economic functioning is substantially disrupted;.
2. Allege that such condition of the person is evidenced by a pattern of conduct
which is dangerous to the person or to others;.
3. State that the person is a child or state facts sufficient for a determination
of indigency of the person;.
4. Be supported by the affidavit of each petitioner who has personal knowledge
which avers with particularity the factual basis for the allegations contained in the
petition; and.
