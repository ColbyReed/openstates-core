SECTION 2. 16.297 of the statutes is created to read:
16.297 Grants for local government expenditures; moral obligation
pledge. (1) DEFINITIONS. In this section:
- 2018 Legislature -9-                                                    ALL:all
(a) “Local governmental unit” means a city, village, town, or county that
contains any part of an electronics and information technology manufacturing zone
designated under s. 238.396 (1m).
(b) “Municipal obligation” has the meaning given in s. 67.01 (6).
(1m) GRANTS. From the appropriation under s. 20.505 (1) (fr), the department
may make one or more grants to a local governmental unit for the local governmental
unit's expenditures for costs the department determines are associated with
development occurring in an electronics and information technology manufacturing
zone designated under s. 238.396 (1m), including costs related to infrastructure and
public safety.
(2) MATCH. The department may require a local governmental unit to match
in whole or in part a grant the department makes to the local governmental unit
under sub. (1m).
(2m) CONTRACT. The secretary may contract with a local governmental unit to
implement subs. (1m) and (2).
(3) MORAL OBLIGATION PLEDGE. (a) Recognizing its moral obligation to do so, the
legislature expresses its expectation and aspiration that, if ever called upon to do so,
it shall make an appropriation to pay the principal and interest of a local
governmental unit's municipal obligations, if all of the following apply:
1. The local governmental unit's municipal obligation is issued to finance costs
related to development occurring in or for the benefit of an electronics and
information technology manufacturing zone designated under s. 238.396 (1m).
2.   The secretary designates the moral obligation pledge for the local
governmental unit's municipal obligation before the municipal obligation is issued,
- 2018 Legislature - 10 -                                                LRB-4158/1

obligations under par. (a) shall be subject to the moral obligation pledge under that

under this subsection shall be used to finance costs related to development occurring
in or for the benefit of an electronics and information technology manufacturing zone
designated under s. 238.396 (1m). The legislature determines that the provision of
assistance by state agencies to a local governmental unit under this section, any
appropriation of funds to a local governmental unit under this section, and the moral
obligation pledge under par. (a) serve a substantial statewide public purpose by
assisting the development of an electronics and information technology
manufacturing zone in the state, by encouraging economic development, by reducing
unemployment, and by bringing needed capital into the state for the benefit and
welfare of people throughout the state.
