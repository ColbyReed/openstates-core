     SECTION 1.  Section 291-14, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:

     "(a)  No person shall stand in the bed or
load-carrying area of any motor vehicle commonly known as a pickup truck while
the vehicle is in operation.  No operator
of any pickup truck shall operate the vehicle with a passenger seated in the
bed or load-carrying area of the vehicle unless:

     (1)  There is no seating available in the cab of
the vehicle;

     (2)  The side racks of the vehicle are securely
attached and the tailboard or tailgate is securely closed;

     (3)  Every passenger in the bed or load-carrying
area of the vehicle is seated on the floor and does not attempt to control
unlashed cargo[.];

provided that any county may adopt a rule or
ordinance that places stricter limitations on a passenger seated in the bed or
loading-carrying area of the vehicle.  In
case of conflict between the requirements or limitations of this section or any
county rule or ordinance regarding a passenger seated in the bed or
loading-carrying area of a pickup truck, the more restrictive requirements
shall apply."

     SECTION
2.  This Act does not affect rights and
duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were
begun before its effective date.

     SECTION
3.  Statutory material to be repealed is
bracketed and stricken.  New statutory
material is underscored.

     SECTION
4.  This Act shall take effect upon its
approval.
