     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that each year,
approximately 165,000 Americans under forty-five years of age are diagnosed
with cancer.  In Hawaii, regardless of age, approximately six thousand
individuals are diagnosed with cancer each year.  According to the Hawaii Tumor
Registry, between 2007 and 2011, the average number of new diagnosed cases of
cancer annually among those aged eighteen through forty-five years was seven
hundred thirty-one.

     Improvements in cancer screening have resulted
in an increase in cancer diagnosis among people in their reproductive years,
many of whom are at risk for premature gonadal failure and permanent
infertility due to chemotherapy or radiation therapy.  For example, women with
cancer who are less than forty years of age have a twenty to ninety per cent
chance of premature ovarian failure resulting from cancer treatment.  Advances
in cancer treatment have resulted in decreased mortality and patients having
longer survival rates for many types of cancer.  As cancer survival rates
increase, many national cancer organizations, such as the President's Cancer
Panel and the National Cancer Institute, acknowledge that more attention should
be directed to ensuring quality of life as it relates to survivorship.

     The legislature further finds that cancer
treatment can contribute to reproductive damage, resulting in subsequent
infertility.  In males, chemotherapy or radiation can adversely affect sperm
number, morphology, and motility and can result in DNA damage.  Surgery to
reproductive organs such as testes can affect fertility and pelvic surgery can
result in nerve damage, interfering with ejaculation.  In females, cancer
treatment can damage or destroy oocytes and follicles, cause hormone imbalance,
and interfere with the functioning of the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, or
cervix.  Surgery to remove female reproductive organs hinders the ability to
become pregnant or carry a pregnancy.  Total body, abdominal, or pelvic
radiation can cause ovarian and uterine damage, increasing the risk of
miscarriage or low-birth weight infants.

     Medical literature indicates that infertility
can be a devastating consequence of cancer treatment, thus adversely affecting
the quality of life of cancer survivors.  Infertility can have long-term
psychological effects among survivors, which may be experienced years after
treatment.  Cancer patients report that the possible or actual loss of
fertility causes immense psychosocial distress.  Thus, having options for
fertility preservation can ultimately reduce distress and improve quality of
life.

     The legislature further finds that although
reproductive medicine offers several methods to preserve fertility, the most
successful and established or standard methods for fertility preservation are
sperm cryopreservation for males and embryo cryopreservation for females.  In
2013, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine expanded standard
fertility preservation methods to include oocyte cryopreservation for females
because of its significantly improved success rate.  Accordingly, the procedure
is no longer considered an experimental method.  However, other fertility
preservation alternatives that are considered experimental should only be
offered in a research setting as part of an institutional review board-approved
protocol, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.  For
these reasons, this Act only mandates insurance coverage for standard fertility
preservation procedures, specifically sperm cryopreservation for adult males
and embryo or oocyte cryopreservation for adult females.

     Sperm cryopreservation for males is a procedure
to preserve sperm cells through freezing semen.  It is recommended that the
semen specimen should be collected prior to the start of chemotherapy because
there is a higher risk of genetic damage in sperm collected after chemotherapy
has commenced.

     Embryo cryopreservation for females is the
process of preserving an embryo through freezing techniques.  It requires a
cycle of in vitro fertilization in which the ovaries are stimulated to produce
eggs, which are then fertilized by male sperm through intracytoplasmic sperm
injection.  Embryos can be stored and used years later.

     The legislature further finds that cancer
patients have a right to be informed of accurate information on cancer
treatment-associated risks of infertility, options available in preserving
their fertility, and the costs involved.  The literature shows that there is an
increasing interest among cancer patients in preserving their fertility. 
However, fertility-sparing options are often not pursued due to financial
barriers.  The American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society
for Reproductive Medicine recommend that health care providers address the
possibility of infertility and options for fertility preservation with patients
who are anticipating cancer treatment during their reproductive years. 
However, the cost and lack of insurance coverage are major reasons cited by
oncologists to explain why information on fertility preservation options is not
provided to their patients.  A person of reproductive age, newly diagnosed with
cancer, has to consider not only how to finance the cancer treatment but also
the daunting possibility of permanent infertility as a result and the
additional stressor of the costs for fertility preservation, if considering
having children in the future.

     Hawaii's current insurance code mandates
insurance coverage for one cycle of in vitro fertilization procedures for
married couples experiencing infertility.  According to several national and
international health organizations, infertility is defined as failure to
achieve pregnancy over a specified period of time, usually one year, when
engaging in regular, unprotected sexual intercourse.  However, people diagnosed
with cancer do not meet the criteria for any definition of infertility because
they have not technically been diagnosed as infertile at the time of their
cancer diagnosis, as they do not yet meet the time requirement for unsuccessful
conception.  Therefore, if persons of reproductive age who are diagnosed with
cancer want to preserve their fertility prior to starting treatment, for the
purpose of future parenting, they would have to bear the full costs.  In
Hawaii, sperm cryopreservation costs between $300 and $700.  Embryo and oocyte
cryopreservation costs can range from $12,000 to $20,000, with variations due
to individual reproductive clinic costs and medication regimens used.

     The purpose of this Act is to require Hawaii
insurance companies to include as a covered benefit embryo, oocyte, and sperm
cryopreservation procedures for:

     (1)  Adult females of reproductive potential; and 

     (2)  Adult males,

who are diagnosed with cancer and have not started
cancer treatment.

     SECTION 2.  Chapter 431, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to article 10A to be appropriately
designated and to read as follows:

     "ยง431:10A-     Embryo,
