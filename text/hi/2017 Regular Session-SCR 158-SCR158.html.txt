     WHEREAS, because of Hawaii's historically diverse
culture, the State is often celebrated around the world as being a place of
many unique tastes and flavors; and

 

     WHEREAS, one of these unique foods is shave ice,
which came to Hawaii by way of Japanese sugar plantation laborers; and

 

     WHEREAS, as these Japanese plantation laborers
began transitioning from the plantations to opening their own local businesses,
they would often offer shave ice in their stores, which became extremely
popular among Hawaii residents; and

 

     WHEREAS, although variations of shave ice exist
around the world under different names, the shave ice in Hawaii is particularly
unique in how the ice is cut and the variety of toppings and other treats
incorporated in the snack; and

 

     WHEREAS, even today, shave ice continues to be
popular with local residents and tourists; and

 

     WHEREAS, former President of the United States Barack
Obama enjoys eating shave ice with his family when he visits Hawaii; and

 

     WHEREAS, although several states have designated
certain foods as state snacks, including Illinois, New York, South Carolina,
Texas, and Utah, Hawaii does not have an official state snack; and

 

     WHEREAS, declaring shave ice as the State's
official state snack further celebrates the diverse food culture in Hawaii and
creates a stronger association with the State and one of its most iconic snacks;
now, therefore,

 

     BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Twenty-ninth
Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2017, the House of
Representatives concurring, that the Governor is requested to issue a
proclamation to designate shave ice as the official state snack of the State of
Hawaii; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a certified copy of
this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Governor.
