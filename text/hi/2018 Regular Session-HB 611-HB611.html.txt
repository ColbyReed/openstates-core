     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the Hawaii
2025:  State Plan Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, published by
the executive office on aging, identifies goals and key strategies to improve
the lives of the numerous families affected by the disease.  The legislature
further finds that Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in
the United States and that it affects twenty-seven thousand Hawaii residents, a
number that will increase by more than forty per cent by the year 2025.  The
legislature also finds that an estimated sixty-five thousand unpaid caregivers
in this State provide seventy-four million hours of unpaid care each year.

     With the significantly high number of
individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease as a person having the disease or
as a caregiver, and the substantial projected increase by 2025, there is a need
for a coordinated and prepared support system to address the multitude of
issues arising from addressing the disease.  While the Hawaii 2025:  State
Plan Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias identifies strategies to
address the disease, the services and activities require coordination at a
systemic level, such as through a coordinator position.

     The purpose of this Act is to make an
appropriation for an Alzheimer's disease and related dementia services
coordinator position.

     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the
general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $80,000 or so much thereof
as may be necessary for fiscal year 2017-2018 and the same sum or so much
thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2018-2019 for the establishment of
one full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) Alzheimer's disease and related dementia
services coordinator position, exempt from chapter 76, Hawaii Revised Statutes,
within the executive office on aging.

     The sums appropriated shall be expended
by the department of health for the purposes of this Act.

     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July
1, 2017.
