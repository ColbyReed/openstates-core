SECTION 1.  The legislature
finds that the term "marijuana" originated as a slang term to
describe the genus of plants that is scientifically known as cannabis.  "Marijuana"
has no scientific basis but carries prejudicial implications rooted in racial
stereotypes from the early twentieth century era when cannabis use was first criminalized
in the United States.  The term "cannabis" carries no such negative
connotations and is a more accurate and appropriate term to describe a plant
that has been legalized for medicinal use in Hawaii, twenty-seven other states,
the District of Columbia, and the United States territories of Guam and Puerto
Rico.

The legislature further
finds that all references to "medical marijuana" and "medical
use of marijuana" contained in the Hawaii Revised Statutes and Hawaii
Administrative Rules should be amended to instead refer to "medical
cannabis."

SECTION 2.  All references
to "medical marijuana," "medical use of marijuana," "manufactured
marijuana products" and like terms, as the case may be, in chapter 329D, part
IX of chapter 329, and sections 46-4, 201-13.9, 209E-2, 235-2.4, 304A-1865, 321-30.1,
421J-16, 453-1.3, 514A-88.5, 514B-113, 521-39, and 846-2.7, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, shall be amended to "medical cannabis," "medical use
of cannabis," "manufactured cannabis products" or like terms, as
the case may be, as the context requires.

SECTION 3.  The department
of health shall amend title 11 of the Hawaii Administrative Rules in
conformance with section 2 of this Act.

SECTION 4.  By operation of
law, title 11 of the Hawaii Administrative Rules shall be construed as having
been amended in conformance with section 2 of this Act.

     SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect upon its
approval.
