     WHEREAS, taxpayers find it difficult to resolve
tax issues due to a lack of responsive communication from the Department of
Taxation; and

 

     WHEREAS, the Department of Taxation's telephone
queue currently holds only twenty calls, and there are only fifteen employees
answering these calls; and

 

     WHEREAS, the number of calls received by the
Department of Taxation's taxpayer services line can reach up to hundreds of
calls per day; and

 

     WHEREAS, during periods of high call volume,
taxpayers can be put on hold for extended periods of time or told to call back
at another time; and

 

     WHEREAS, a lack of responsive communication can be
especially frustrating for taxpayers facing payment deadlines and the threat of
mounting penalties; now, therefore,

 

     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of
the Twenty-ninth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2017, that
the Department of Taxation is requested to upgrade and modernize its
communication system; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, as part of this
upgrade, the Department of Taxation is requested to increase its number of call
centers, improve its internet chat and electronic mail capabilities, and
establish and maintain a better frequently asked questions page on its website;
and

 

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of
Taxation is requested to report to the Legislature on the progress of this
upgrade no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session
of 2018; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a certified copy of
this Resolution be transmitted to the Director of Taxation.
