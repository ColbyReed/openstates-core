to each taxpayer subject to the tax imposed under this chapter, a cesspool
upgrade, conversion, or connection income tax credit that shall be deductible
from the taxpayer's net income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter
for the taxable year in which the credit is properly claimed.  A taxpayer
eligible to claim a tax credit under this section may assign all or a portion
of a tax credit under this section to any assignee.  An assignee may
subsequently assign a tax credit or any portion of a tax credit assigned under
this subsection to one or more assignees.  A taxpayer may claim a portion of a
tax credit and assign the remaining tax credit amount.  A tax credit assignment
under this subsection shall be irrevocable.  The tax credit assignment under
this subsection shall be made on a form prescribed by the department of
taxation.  A taxpayer claiming a tax credit under this section shall submit a
copy of the completed assignment form to the department in the tax year in
which the assignment is made and shall attach a copy of the form to the tax
return on which the tax credit is claimed.

     (b)  In the case of a partnership, S
corporation, estate, or trust, the tax credit allowable is for qualified
expenses incurred by the entity for the taxable year.  The expenses upon which
the tax credit is computed shall be determined at the entity level. 
Distribution and share of credit shall be determined by rule.

     If a taxpayer is awarded a grant under
section 342D-B, no tax credit shall be allowed for that portion of qualified
expenses paid for by grant moneys.

     (c)  The cesspool upgrade, conversion, or
connection income tax credit shall be equal to the qualified expenses of the
taxpayer, up to a maximum of $10,000; provided that, in the case of a qualified
cesspool that is a residential large capacity cesspool, the amount of the
credit shall be equal to the qualified expenses of the taxpayer, up to a
maximum of $10,000 per residential dwelling connected to the cesspool, as
certified by the department of health pursuant to subsection (e).  There shall
be allowed a maximum of one cesspool upgrade, conversion, or connection income
tax credit per qualified cesspool or per tax map key number where more than one
residence is connected to a residential large-capacity cesspool.  The cesspool
upgrade, conversion, or connection income tax credit shall be available only
for the taxable year in which the taxpayer's qualified expenses are certified
by the appropriate government agency.

     (d)  The total amount of tax credits allowed
under this section shall not exceed $5,000,000 for all taxpayers in any taxable
year; provided that any taxpayer who is not eligible to claim the credit in a
taxable year due to the $5,000,000 cap having been exceeded for that taxable
year shall be eligible to claim the credit in the subsequent taxable year.

     (e)  The department of health shall:

     (1)  Certify all qualified cesspools for the purposes
of this section; provided that, as a pilot program, the department of health,
in its discretion, may certify no more than two residential large capacity
cesspools as qualified cesspools;

     (2)  Collect and maintain a record of all qualified
expenses certified by an appropriate government agency for the taxable year;
and

     (3)  Certify to each taxpayer the amount of credit the
taxpayer may claim; provided that if, in any year, the annual amount of certified
credits reaches $5,000,000 in the aggregate, the department of health shall
immediately discontinue certifying credits and notify the department of
taxation.

The director of health may adopt rules under chapter
91 as necessary to implement the certification requirements under this section.

     (f)  The director of taxation:

     (1)  Shall prepare any forms that may be necessary to
claim a tax credit under this section;

     (2)  May require the taxpayer to furnish reasonable
information to ascertain the validity of the claim for the tax credit made under
this section; and

     (3)  May adopt rules under chapter 91 necessary to
effectuate the purposes of this section.

    (g)  If the tax credit under this section
exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess of the credit over
liability [may be used as a credit against the taxpayer's income tax
liability in subsequent years until exhausted.] shall be refunded to the
taxpayer; provided that tax credits properly claimed by an individual who has
no income tax liability shall be paid to the individual; and provided further
that no refunds or payment on account of the tax credits allowed by this
section shall be made for amounts less than $1.  All claims for the tax
credit under this section, including amended claims, shall be filed on or
before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for
which the credit may be claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing
provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.

    (h)  This section shall not apply to taxable
years beginning after December 31, [2020.] 2022.

     (i)  The tax credit under this section shall
