     SECTION 1.  The
legislature finds that the Hawaii keiki:  healthy and ready to learn program (Hawaii
keiki program) is designed to improve access to, and the quality of, school-based
health services available to Hawaii's public school students by coordinating
and expanding existing efforts of community partners and resources.  This
partnership program with the University of Hawaii at Manoa school of nursing
and dental hygiene supports the department of education in achieving student,
school, and system success by providing school health nursing and primary care
services to public schools in five complex areas.

     In 2015, the
legislature appropriated general funds to improve access to, and increase the
quality of, health services available to Hawaii's public school students.  This
appropriation led to the expansion of the Hawaii keiki program, with five
advanced practice registered nurses and five registered nurses serving seven
complex areas across three islands.  During this time, the Hawaii keiki program
also established five school-based health centers.

     The legislature
further finds that the department of education is working with other state agencies,
partnering organizations, and families to improve attendance, behavior, and
course marks by partnering to coordinate wraparound services that address
non-school factors that impede student success.  Further, through the Hawaii
keiki program collaboration, the departments of health and human services have identified
the extent of services provided within each department targeted to public school
children and the need to coordinate internal departmental activity and cross
departmental efforts to develop sustainable school-based health services.

     The legislature additionally
finds that chronic absenteeism, poor health, and delayed or limited access to
health care and preventive services continue to hinder academic success and
meeting the needs of the whole child.  The legislature acknowledges that the
Hawaii keiki program is an effective means by which to continue collaboration
between health, human services, and education policymakers and providers to
achieve sustainable, comprehensive school-based health services in the State to
improve the academic and health outcomes of Hawaii's public school students.  Working
with each complex area superintendent and school principals, the Hawaii keiki
program builds and enhances school-based health services that reflect the
specific needs of the individual complex area according to student
demographics, staffing, available support services, and access to health care
within the community, including:

     (1)  Providing comprehensive screening for physical
and behavioral health conditions;

     (2)  Providing referrals to primary and behavioral
health care and patient-centered medical home services;

     (3)  Preventing and controlling communicable diseases
and other health problems;

     (4)  Providing emergency care for illness or injury;
and

     (5)  Collaborating with community partners, including
federally qualified health centers, the Hawaii chapter of the American Academy
of Pediatrics, Hui for Excellence in Education Coalition, and other key
stakeholders to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to implement
school-based health.

     The legislature
also finds that the expected cost to continue and expand the Hawaii keiki
program to include students from pre-kindergarten through high school in the fifteen
department of education complex areas statewide; expand the program to allow
the Hawaii state public charter school commission to launch the program in two
public charter schools serving disadvantaged keiki; provide access to
preventive oral health services and establish a pilot oral health screening and
preventative services program on a neighbor island; enhance data collection, sharing,
analysis, and reporting; and engage in interdepartmental school health
coordination, is $4,000,000 annually, in addition to a one-time allocation of
$500,000 for an evidence based vision screening tool.  These funds will additionally
establish school health services coordinator roles in the department of health
and the MedQUEST division of the department of human services.

     The purpose of this Act is to formally establish the Hawaii keiki:  healthy and ready to learn
program, provide funding to expand and
sustain the program, and appropriate funds to establish school health service
coordinators in the departments of health and human services to increase
coordination and facilitate departmental and interdepartmental activities
related to comprehensive school-based health services.

     SECTION 2.  Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, is amended by adding two new sections to be appropriately designated
