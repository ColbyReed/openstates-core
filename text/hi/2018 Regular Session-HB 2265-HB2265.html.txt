     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that many tourists who
visit the State participate in watersports in the oceans surrounding the State,
such as snorkeling, scuba diving, kayaking, and surfing lessons.  There are companies that conduct commercial
operations which take customers on excursions in state waters for the purpose
of engaging in recreation activities.  These
commercial operations are required to obtain a permit from the division of
boating and ocean recreation of the department of land and natural
resources.  However, the provisions for
obtaining those permits do not include any safety requirements, which can lead
to potential consumer safety issues.

     The legislature further
finds that House Concurrent Resolution No. 86, H.D. 1, S.D. 1, adopted in 2015,
requested the department of land and natural resources to engage stakeholders
to consider adopting permitting provisions requiring employees of companies who
take customers on watersport excursions to be trained in basic water safety
measures.  The department has not taken
action to carry out the provisions of this resolution since its adoption.

     The purpose of this Act
is to require the department of land and natural resources to adopt rules
regulating the activity of watersport excursion companies to provide for more customer
safety measures. 

     SECTION 2.  The department of land and natural resources
shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, by July 1,
2019, regulating the commercial ocean operators that take customers into state
waters for the purpose of engaging in activities such as snorkeling, scuba
diving, kayaking, and surfing lessons. 
In adopting these rules, the department shall require that:

     (1)  Commercial
operators that allow customers to participate in an activity in state waters away
from a vessel maintain a ratio of at least one tour guide or instructor per
eight participants;

     (2)  Each tour guide and instructor shall have a
dive master or lifeguard certification from a nationally recognized
certification organization; and

     (3)  Vessels used by commercial operators to transport
customers for the purpose of engaging in an activity in ocean waters shall
include a backboard and emergency oxygen in onboard safety equipment.

     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
