     SECTION 1.  Section 482E-6, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, is amended to read as follows:

     "ยง482E-6  Relationship between
franchisor or subfranchisor and franchisee.  Without limiting the other
provisions of this chapter, the following specific rights and prohibitions
shall govern the relation between the franchisor or subfranchisor and its
franchisees:

     (1)  The parties shall deal with each other in good
faith[.];

     (2)  For the purposes of this chapter and without
limiting its general application, it shall be an unfair or deceptive act or
practice or an unfair method of competition for a franchisor or subfranchisor
to:

         (A)  Restrict the right of the franchisees to
join an association of franchisees[.];

         (B)  Require a franchisee to purchase or lease
goods or services of the franchisor or from designated sources of supply unless
[such] the restrictive purchasing agreements are reasonably
necessary for a lawful purpose justified on business grounds.  Suppliers
suggested or approved by a franchisor as meeting its standards and requirements
shall not be deemed designated sources of supply[.];

         (C)  Discriminate between franchisees in the
charges offered or made for royalties, goods, services, equipment, rentals,
advertising services, or in any other business dealing, unless and to the
extent that any classification of or discrimination between franchisees is:

              (i)  Based on franchises granted at materially
different times, and [such] the discrimination is reasonably
related to [such] the differences in time;

             (ii)  [Is related] Related to one
or more programs for making franchises available to persons with insufficient
capital, training, business experience, or education, or lacking
other qualifications;

            (iii)  [Is related] Related to local
or regional experimentation with or variations in product or service lines,
or business formats or designs;

             (iv)  [Is related] Related to
efforts by one or more franchisees to cure deficiencies in the operation of
franchise businesses or defaults in franchise agreements; or

              (v)  [Is based] Based on other
reasonable distinctions considering the purposes of this chapter and is not
arbitrary[.];

         (D)  Obtain money, goods, services, anything of
value, or any other benefit from any other person with whom the franchisee does
business on account of [such] that business unless the franchisor
advises the franchisee in advance of the franchisor's intention to receive [such]
the benefit[.];

         (E)  Establish a similar business or [to]
grant a franchise for the establishment of a similar business at a location
within a geographical area specifically designated as the exclusive territory
in a franchise previously granted to another franchisee in a currently
effective agreement, except under the circumstances or conditions prescribed in
[such] the agreement.  The fact that other franchisees or the
franchisor may solicit business or sell goods or services to [people] persons
residing in [such] the geographical territory shall not
constitute the establishment of a similar business within the exclusive
territory[.];

         (F)  Require a franchisee at the time of
entering into a franchise to assent to a release, assignment, novation, or
waiver [which] that would relieve any person from liability
imposed by this chapter.  Any condition, stipulation, or provision
binding any person acquiring any franchise to waive compliance with any
provision of this chapter or a rule [promulgated hereunder] adopted
shall be void.  This paragraph shall not bar or affect the settlement of
disputes, claims, or civil suits arising or brought under this chapter[.];

         (G)  Impose on a franchisee by contract, rule,
or regulation, whether written or oral, any unreasonable and arbitrary standard
of conduct[.];

         (H)  Terminate or refuse to renew a franchise
except for good cause, or in accordance with the current terms and standards
established by the franchisor then equally applicable to all franchisees,
unless and to the extent that the franchisor satisfies the burden of proving
that any classification of or discrimination between franchisees is reasonable,
is based on proper and justifiable distinctions considering the purposes of
this chapter, and is not arbitrary.  For purposes of this paragraph, good cause
in a termination case shall include[,] but not be limited to[,]
the failure of the franchisee to comply with any lawful, material provision of
the franchise agreement after having been given written notice thereof and an
opportunity to cure the failure within a reasonable period of time[.];

         (I)  Refuse to permit a transfer of ownership
of a franchise, or of a proprietorship, partnership, corporation or other
business entity that is a franchisee or subfranchisor, except for good cause. 
For purposes of this paragraph good cause shall include, but not be limited to:

              (i)  The failure of a proposed transferee to
meet any of the franchisor's or subfranchisor's reasonable qualifications or
standards then in effect for a franchisee or subfranchisor;

             (ii)  The fact that the proposed transferee or
any affiliated person of the proposed transferee is a competitor of the
franchisor or subfranchisor;

            (iii)  The inability or unwillingness of the
proposed transferee to agree in writing to comply with and be bound by all
lawful obligations imposed by the franchise, including without limitation all
instruction and training obligations, and to sign the current form of franchise
agreement used by the franchisor or subfranchisor; and

             (iv)  The failure of the franchisee or proposed
transferee to pay any sums owing to the franchisor and to cure any default in
the franchise agreement or other agreements with the franchisor existing at the
time of the proposed transfer.

              A franchisor or subfranchisor shall
have thirty days after being notified in writing of a proposed transfer to
approve or disapprove in writing a proposed transfer of ownership or control of
a franchise, or of a proprietorship, partnership, corporation or other business
entity that is a franchisee or subfranchisor, stating its reason for
disapproval.  If a franchisor or subfranchisor fails to approve or disapprove a
proposed transfer in writing within [such] this period, the
franchisor or subfranchisor shall be deemed to have approved [such] the
transfer[.]; and

         (J)  Restrain a franchisee,
directly or indirectly, from sourcing processing services for electronic credit
cards, credit identifications, debit cards, prepaid cards, or other transaction
authorization cards from processing service providers of the franchisee's
choosing when these processing services are used, or could reasonably be
anticipated to be used, by a franchisee in a substantial amount of its
commercial transactions; provided that it is not a violation of this section
for a franchisor to establish reasonable, written, specific standards regarding
the nature and quality of the processing service providers;

     (3)  Upon termination or refusal to renew the
franchise the franchisee shall be compensated for the fair market value, at the
time of the termination or expiration of the franchise, of the franchisee's
inventory, supplies, equipment, and furnishings purchased from the
franchisor or a supplier designated by the franchisor; provided that the
franchisee need not be compensated for personalized materials [which]
that have no value to the franchisor [need not be compensated for]. 
If the franchisor refuses to renew a franchise for the purpose of converting
the franchisee's business to one owned and operated by the franchisor, the
franchisor, in addition to the remedies provided in this paragraph, shall
compensate the franchisee for the loss of goodwill.  The franchisor may deduct
from [such] the compensation reasonable costs incurred in
removing, transporting, and disposing of the franchisee's inventory,
supplies, equipment, and furnishings pursuant to this [requirement,] paragraph
and may offset from [such] the compensation any moneys due to
the franchisor[.];

     (4)  [The provisions of this] This
chapter shall apply to all written or oral arrangements with the franchisee
including but not limited to the franchise offering, the franchise agreement,
sales of goods or services, leases and mortgages of real or personal property,
promises to pay, security interest, pledges, insurance contracts, advertising
contracts, construction or installation contracts, servicing contracts, and all
other [such] arrangements in which the franchisor or subfranchisor has
any direct or indirect interest[.]; and

     (5)  In any proceedings, damages may be based
on reasonable approximations but not on speculation."

     SECTION 2.  Section 482E-9, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:

     "(b)  Any person who sells or offers to
sell a franchise in violation of this chapter shall be liable to the franchisee
or subfranchisor who may sue for damages caused thereby or for rescission or
other relief as the court may deem appropriate.  In the case of a violation of
section 482E-5(b), rescission is not available to the plaintiff if the
defendant proves that the plaintiff knew the facts concerning the untruth or
admission, or [that] the defendant exercised reasonable care and
did not know; or if the defendant had exercised reasonable care would
not have known of the untruth or admission.  In case of a violation of this
chapter where the sole violation was a violation of section 482E-6(2)(J),
rescission is not available."

     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed
is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.

     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its
approval.
