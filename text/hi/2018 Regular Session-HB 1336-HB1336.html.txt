     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the
Wahiawa dam and reservoir, now known as Lake Wilson, was built by the Waialua
Agricultural Company in 1903.  The dam has a current capacity of 2,500,000,000
gallons and has created a seven-mile-long reservoir that takes advantage of the
natural stream beds and canyons located in the Kaukonahua gulch.

     The legislature also finds that pumped-storage
hydroelectricity is a type of hydroelectric energy storage used by electric
power systems for load balancing.  The legislature finds that the agribusiness
development corporation recently approved a lease to the Kauai Island Utility
Cooperative for a hydropower project in Kekaha.  The legislature further finds
that Lake Wilson dam also has the potential to mass-produce hydroelectric
energy.

     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds
to the agribusiness development corporation for a study to be conducted in
cooperation with the United States Army Corps of Engineers on the merits of
acquiring Lake Wilson dam and spillway for the purposes of upgrading the dam
and developing pumped-storage hydroelectricity; provided that federal matching funds
are made available.

     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the
general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $1,500,000 or so much
thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2017-2018 and the same sum or so
much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2018-2019 for a study to be
conducted in cooperation with the United States Army Corps of Engineers on the
merits of acquiring Lake Wilson dam and spillway for the purposes of upgrading
the dam and developing pumped-storage hydroelectricity; provided that no funds
shall be made available under this Act unless matched on a dollar-for-dollar
basis by the federal government for the purpose for which the sums are
appropriated.

     The sums appropriated shall be expended by the agribusiness
development corporation for the purposes of this Act.

     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2017.
