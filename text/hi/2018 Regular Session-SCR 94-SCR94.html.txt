     WHEREAS, Hawaii
imports ninety percent of its food and therefore, increasing local food
production is essential for the future health and vitality of the State; and

 

     WHEREAS, the
Governor has established the goal of doubling local food production by 2020;
and

 

     WHEREAS, the
State has many natural resources and vast agricultural lands that lend
themselves to increased food production; and

 

     WHEREAS, despite
the State's natural resources and goals for increased local food production,
local food production has remained slow to develop over an extended time; and

 

     WHEREAS, Israel,
a country where sufficient fresh water supplies are lacking and where only
approximately twenty percent of the land is arable, has a highly developed
agricultural industry, is a major exporter of fresh produce, and is a
world-leader in agricultural technologies; and

 

     WHEREAS, despite
its lack of natural resources and generally unfavorable farming conditions,
Israel produces approximately ninety-five percent of its own food; and

 

     WHEREAS, Israel
is a strong ally of the United States and would therefore be a useful resource
for local farmers to look to for ideas for implementing advanced agricultural
technologies for the purpose of increasing local food production; now,
therefore,

 

     BE IT
RESOLVED by the Senate of the Twenty-ninth Legislature of the State of Hawaii,
Regular Session of 2018, the House of Representatives concurring, that this
body urges all farmers in the State to examine Israel's agricultural
technologies which allow Israel to produce ninety-five percent of its own food
despite unfavorable farming conditions, for techniques and ideas that can be
implemented in the State to increase local food production; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER
RESOLVED that this body urges the Department of Agriculture and University of
Hawai‘i College of
Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources to encourage farmers and students
across the State to examine Israel's agricultural technologies for techniques
and ideas that can be implemented in the State to increase local food
production; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER
RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the
Chairperson of the Board of Agriculture and Dean of the University of Hawai‘i College of Tropical
Agriculture and Human Resources.
