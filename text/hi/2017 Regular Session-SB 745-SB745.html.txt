     SECTION 1.  Section 587A-11, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
amended to read as follows:

     "ยง587A-11  Investigation; department
powers[.]; rights of parents and guardians.  (a)  Upon
receiving a report that a child is subject to imminent harm, has been harmed,
or is subject to threatened harm, and when an assessment is required by this
chapter, the department shall cause such investigation to be made as it deems
to be appropriate.  In conducting the investigation, the department may:

     (1)  Enlist the cooperation and assistance of
appropriate state and federal law enforcement authorities, who may conduct an
investigation and, if an investigation is conducted, shall provide the
department with all preliminary findings, including the results of a criminal
history record check of an alleged perpetrator of harm or threatened harm to
the child;

     (2)  Conduct a criminal history record check of an
alleged perpetrator and all adults living in the family home, with or without
consent, to ensure the safety of the child;

     (3)  Interview the child without the presence or prior
approval of the child's family and temporarily assume protective custody of the
child for the purpose of conducting the interview;

     (4)  Resolve the matter in an informal fashion that it
deems appropriate under the circumstances;

     (5)  Close the matter if the department finds, after
an assessment, that the child is residing with a caregiver who is willing and
able to meet the child's needs and provide a safe and appropriate placement for
the child;

     (6)  Immediately enter into a service plan:

         (A)  To safely maintain the child in the family
home; or

         (B)  To place the child in voluntary foster
care pursuant to a written agreement with the child's parent.

          If the child is placed in voluntary foster care
and the family does not successfully complete the service plan within three
months after the date on which the department assumed physical custody of the
child, the department shall file a petition.  The department is not required to
file a petition if the parents agree to adoption or legal guardianship of the
child and the child's safety is ensured; provided that the adoption or legal
guardianship hearing is conducted within six months of the date on which the
department assumed physical custody of the child;

     (7)  Assume temporary foster custody of the child and
file a petition with the court within three days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays,
and holidays, after the date on which the department assumes temporary foster
custody of the child, with placement preference being given to an approved
relative; or

     (8)  File a petition or ensure that a petition is
filed by another appropriate authorized agency in court under this chapter.

     (b)  If the department conducts an
investigation or enlists the cooperation and assistance of appropriate state
and federal law enforcement authorities to conduct an investigation pursuant to
subsection (a), at the time of any initial face-to-face contact with the
child's parent or guardian during the investigation, the department or appropriate
law enforcement authority shall provide the parent or guardian with written
notice that:

     (1)  The parent or guardian is not required
to permit the department or law enforcement authority to enter the residence of
the parent or guardian;

     (2)  The parent or guardian is not required
to speak with the department or law enforcement authority at that time;

     (3)  The parent or guardian is entitled to
seek representation of an attorney and have an attorney present when the parent
or guardian is questioned by the department or law enforcement authority;

     (4)  Any statement made by the parent,
guardian, or other family member may be used against the parent or guardian in
a hearing initiated pursuant to this chapter;

     (5)  The representative of the department or
law enforcement authority is not an attorney and cannot provide legal advice to
the parent or guardian;

     (6)  The parent or guardian is not required
to sign any document presented by the department or law enforcement authority,
including but not limited to a release of claims or a service agreement, and is
entitled to have an attorney review any document before the parent or guardian
agrees to sign; and

     (7)  A failure of the parent or guardian to
communicate with the department or law enforcement authority may have serious
consequences, which may include the filing of a petition under this chapter and
the assumption of temporary foster custody of the child by the department;
therefore it is in the parent's or guardian's best interest to speak with the
department or law enforcement authority or immediately seek the advice of a
qualified attorney.

     (c)  The department or appropriate law
enforcement authority shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the notice
provided to a parent or guardian under this section is written in a manner that
will be understood by the parent or guardian, including but not limited to
ensuring that the notice is written in a language understood by the parent or
guardian.

     (d)  The department or appropriate law
enforcement authority shall request the parent or guardian to sign and date the
notice required by subsection (b) as evidence of having received the notice. 
If the parent or guardian refuses to sign and date the notice upon request, the
department or law enforcement authority shall specifically indicate on the
notice the department's or law enforcement authority's request to sign and the
parent or guardian's refusal to do so.  The department or law enforcement
authority shall sign the notice as witness to the parent's or guardian's
refusal to sign and provide the parent or guardian with a copy of the signed
notice at the time of the initial face-to-face contact with the parent or
guardian."

     SECTION 2.  Statutory material to be repealed is
bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.

     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect upon its
approval.
