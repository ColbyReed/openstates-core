     WHEREAS, the Native Hawaiian Health Care
Improvement Act (42 U.S.C. 122), originally enacted as the Native Hawaiian
Health Care Act of 1988, states, in pertinent part, under title 42 United
States Code section 11701:

 

"(17)  The authority of
the Congress under the United States Constitution to legislate in matters
affecting the aboriginal or indigenous peoples of the United States includes
the authority to legislate in matters affecting the native peoples of Alaska
and Hawaii.

 

(18)  In furtherance of the
trust responsibility for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians,
the United States has established a program for the provision of comprehensive
health promotion and disease prevention services to maintain and improve the
health status of the Hawaiian people."; and

 

     WHEREAS, section 11702 of the United States Code
states, in pertinent part, as follows:

 

"The
Congress hereby declares that it is the policy of the United States in
fulfillment of its special responsibilities and legal obligations to the
indigenous people of Hawaii resulting from the unique and historical
relationship between the United States and the Government of the indigenous
people of Hawaii—

 

(1)  to raise the health status of Native
Hawaiians to the highest possible health level; and

 

(2)  to provide existing Native Hawaiian
health care programs with all resources necessary to effectuate this policy."
(emphasis added); and

 

     WHEREAS, title 42 United States Code section 11705(h)
authorizes appropriations necessary for fiscal years 1993 through 2019; and

 

     WHEREAS, stakeholders face continued uncertainty regarding
long-term funding beyond fiscal year 2019; and

 

     WHEREAS, according to the United States Census
Bureau's report, "The Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander
Population: 2010", the nation's Native Hawaiian population increased by
31.4 per cent between 2000 and 2010 with approximately fifty-five per cent of
that population living in Hawaii, and by 2015, the Native Hawaiian population
was 568,067 nationwide; and

 

     WHEREAS, Act 42, Session Laws of Hawaii 2003,
codified as section 10-18, Hawaii Revised Statutes, established the Hui ‘Imi Advisory Council within
the Office of Hawaiian Affairs; and

 

     WHEREAS, the
Department of Health published a report in 2011, entitled "Chronic Disease
Disparities Report 2011:  Social Determinants", which found that chronic
diseases—such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and chronic lower
respiratory diseases—are the most prevalent, most disabling, and most costly of
all diseases; and

 

     WHEREAS, the Department of Native Hawaiian Health
of the John A. Burns School of Medicine at the University of Hawaii at Manoa
published a report in 2013, entitled "Assessment and priorities for Health
and Well-Being in Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Peoples", which found
that:  Hawaii's Native Hawaiian population had a lower life expectancy than
other populations and had higher rates of death from heart disease, cancer,
stroke, diabetes, and injuries compared to the State's overall population; and half
of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders report being obese; and

 

     WHEREAS, social determinants of health and other
factors contribute to the continued health disparities that affect the Native
Hawaiian population; and

 

     WHEREAS, while Hawaii and the country in general have
made strides toward improving the health of Native Hawaiians, long-term federal
funding for necessary health programs and services remains at risk; and

 

     WHEREAS, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act is
intended to provide descendants of the indigenous people of the continental
United States assistance with health services; and

 

     WHEREAS, title 25 United States Code section 1680o
of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act provides for permanent funding of the
Act beginning in fiscal year 2010 and each fiscal year thereafter, to remain
available until expended; and

 

     WHEREAS, Native Hawaiians should have the same
assurance given to other indigenous people in the United States regarding
federal funding for health programs and services; now, therefore,

 

     BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Twenty-ninth
Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2017, that the United
States Congress is requested to amend the Native Hawaiian Health Care
Improvement Act to ensure that the Act receives permanent funding; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this
Resolution be transmitted to the President Pro Tempore of the United States
Senate, Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress, Majority
Leader of the United States Senate, Majority Leader of the United States House
