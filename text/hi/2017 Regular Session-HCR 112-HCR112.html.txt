     WHEREAS, in 2015, Hawaii spent $5,700,000,000 on
imported oil, the equivalent of seven percent of the gross state product, and
up to 70 percent of this imported oil is consumed for transportation, with jet
fuel being the greatest and growing share; and

 

     WHEREAS, displacing as little as five percent of
imported oil with a proven renewable source of fuel could significantly improve
Hawaii's energy security, sustainability, and economy by addressing fuel price
volatility; and

 

     WHEREAS, in 2008, the United States Department of
Energy and the State of Hawaii established the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative,
which set a goal of using clean sources to supply 50 percent of the State's electricity
needs and 70 percent of overall energy needs, including transportation, by 2030
and Act 97, Session Laws of Hawaii 2015, increased this renewable electricity
mandate to achieve a 100 percent renewable energy economy in the State by 2045;
and

 

     WHEREAS, the Legislature has also created tax
incentives, such as the biofuel production tax credit established through Act
202, Session Laws of Hawaii 2016, to support the end goal of energy security
and sustainability; and

 

     WHEREAS, the Governor has a stated goal of doubling
local food production to rectify the State's current dependence on imports
under which, as of 2015, 90 percent of food consumed in Hawaii is imported,
including food for schools, hospitals, and prisons, which is a significant increase
since statehood, when the percentage of imported consumed food was closer to 50
percent; and

 

     WHEREAS, the Department of Transportation has
created a Sustainable Transportation Forum, which includes a focus on renewable
fuels among other priorities, and co-sponsored the Hawaii Renewable Transportation
Summit in 2016 with the Hawaii State Energy Office and the University of Hawaii
Applied Research Laboratory; and

 

     WHEREAS, at the federal level, the United States
Departments of Defense, Agriculture, and Energy have collaborated with each
other and the commercial aviation industry to establish a domestic renewable
jet fuel manufacturing capacity and have included Hawaii in this Commercial
Aviation Alternative Fuel Initiative; and

 

     WHEREAS, the federal Sustainable Alternative Jet
Fuel Research and Development Strategy, published in 2016, sets out prioritized
federal research and development goals and objectives to address key scientific
and technical challenges that inhibit the development, production, and use of
economically viable alternative jet fuels at a commercial scale; and

 

     WHEREAS, in 2016, the Obama administration
released a Mid-Century Strategy for Deep Decarbonization, which sets a goal of
80 percent de-carbonization by 2050 and calls for the creation, preparation,
and implementation of a plan by 2030 to reach that goal; and

 

     WHEREAS, Hawaii has opted in to the updated
renewable fuel standard established by the Energy Security and Independence Act
of 2007, which is a standard that requires obligated parties to sell a certain
amount of biofuels per year through 2022, and that has been met to date by
Hawaii petroleum distributors importing biofuels; and

 

     WHEREAS, Hawaii has a limited manufacturing sector
that represents three percent of the gross state product, which is comprised of
petroleum and gas refining; and

     WHEREAS, increased food production integrated with
renewable fuel production will stimulate new storage, hub and depot centers,
and processing plants, and the development of an integrated food and biofuel
supply chain within Hawaii would create storage, pre-processing, and conversion
refinery plants; and

 

     WHEREAS, implementing food production concurrently
with biofuel feedstock production will create economy of scale, provide additional
revenue for farmers, and reduce the overall costs of local food production; and

 

     WHEREAS, the advancement of a vibrant bio-economy
and biofuels supply chain in Hawaii, complementary with food production, could
help address the loss of jobs from plantation and refinery closures and
mitigate the risks of petroleum supply and price shocks, especially to Hawaii's
vital tourism sector; and

 

     WHEREAS, each populated island in Hawaii has
solid, construction, green, food, and human waste processing facilities that
are at or approaching disposal capacity within the next five to thirty years
and commercial enterprises in the continental United States have shown that
these wastes are viable feedstock for renewable fuel production; and

 

     WHEREAS, initiatives, such as the Hawaii Clean
Energy Initiative, have developed and created industries and jobs throughout
Hawaii with the creation of friendly policy, such as new market, high
technology, and renewable energy tax credits; similarly, a Hawaii Green
Initiative for Fuels Transition could spur the creation of production, new
market, refinery and conversion tech tax credits, carbon credits, land use
subsidies and set asides, crop insurance, sustainability and conservation
credits, and other mechanisms to stimulate integrated food and fuel production;
now, therefore,

 

     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of
the Twenty-ninth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2017,
the Senate concurring, that the Governor is encouraged to work with the
Legislature to develop a Hawaii Green Initiative for Fuels Transition to
coincide with increased local food production to encourage the significant
growth, development, intensification, and expansion of agriculture through the
incorporation of both dedicated food and biofuel feedstock growth to achieve
the goals of food and fuel sustainability and security; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of
this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, Director of Business,
Economic Development, and Tourism, Chair of the Board of Agriculture, Chair of
the Public Utilities Commission, Administrator of the State Energy Office, President
and Chair of the Board of Regents of the University of Hawaii, Dean of the
University of Hawaii College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources,
Commander of the United States Pacific Command, Chairs of the Hawaii Energy
Policy Forum, President of the Hawaii Renewable Energy Alliance, Executive
Director of the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuel Initiative, President of
Hawaii Farmers Union United, and President of the Hawaii Farm Bureau.
