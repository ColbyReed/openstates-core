     WHEREAS,
Hawai‘i has limited
resources, space, and carrying capacity; and

 

     WHEREAS,
Hawai‘i has made progress
in energy and food security but still relies upon foreign fossil fuel for
eighty percent of its energy generation and imports a majority of its food
supply; and

 

     WHEREAS,
there is a moral obligation and real responsibility to act as good stewards of
the land and its unique flora and fauna for the current and future generations;
and

 

     WHEREAS,
protection of our natural environment and natural resources benefits and
sustains the State's economy, residents' health and well-being, and enjoyment
of open spaces, parks, and trails; and

 

     WHEREAS, the
definition of sustainability is "development that meets the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
own needs"; and

 

     WHEREAS,
traditional Hawaiian society was able to sustain a thriving population with
advanced agriculture and aquaculture and wise management of land and natural
resources; and

 

     WHEREAS,
global climate change presents an urgent threat to the Hawaiian islands through
sea level rise, ocean acidification, coral bleaching, drought, flooding,
temperature changes, species extinction, infectious disease, and other impacts
that increase risk from deferred maintenance on old infrastructure; and

 

     WHEREAS, in
response to Act 125, Session Laws of Hawaii 2017, the Department of Health
produced a report to the twenty-ninth Legislature related to cesspools and
prioritization for replacement; and

 

     WHEREAS, the
report revealed that there is a need for corresponding research to assess
current wastewater infrastructure in the County of Hawai‘i; and

 

     WHEREAS, while
the wastewater industry has evolved to using natural systems that drive
operational savings and operational results beyond permit compliance, the Hilo
wastewater plant infrastructure is over twenty years old and uses traditional wastewater
treatment processes; and

 

     WHEREAS, for
any significant modifications to the current wastewater management system, the County
of Hawai‘i needs to
conduct a feasibility study; and

 

     WHEREAS, a
technical feasibility study and an infrastructure evaluation must be focused on
cost-effective finance options, including leveraging private sector investment,
energy efficiency, renewable energy, and nutrient resource recovery for
potential energy generation, land and soil regeneration, and other new business
opportunities; now, therefore,

 

     BE IT
RESOLVED by the Senate of the Twenty-ninth Legislature of the State of Hawaii,
Regular Session of 2018, that the County of Hawai‘i
is urged to prioritize infrastructure improvements to wastewater management
through a comprehensive study for economic development, infrastructure,
sustainability, education, and public policy; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER
RESOLVED that the study find ways to maximize current investment in wastewater
systems and all modern and more cost-effective technical and financial models
that improve operations, performance, and cost; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER
RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Mayor
of the County of Hawai‘i,
Chairperson of the Hawai‘i
County Council, and Director of the Department of Environmental Management for
the County of Hawai‘i.
