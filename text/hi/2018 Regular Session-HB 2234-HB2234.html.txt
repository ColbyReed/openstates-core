     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that states fail to collect
more than $23,000,000,000 annually in sales taxes from remote sales over the Internet
and through catalogs.  Hawaii and its
local governments will lose out on an estimated $60,000,000 in sales and use
taxes from remote sales, reducing funds that would otherwise be available for
the public education system, health care services, infrastructure, and other
vital public services.

     The legislature further finds that
Colorado adopted a law requiring out-of-state retailers that do not collect
Colorado's state sales tax to report tax-related information to their Colorado
customers and the Colorado department of revenue.  In 2016, the United States court of appeals
for the tenth circuit upheld that law.

     The intent of this Act is to address
the significant harm and unfairness brought about by the physical presence
nexus rule.  To achieve this objective,
this Act adopts a new program that requires remote sellers who meet a specified
threshold of gross receipts from sales into the State to have the option to collect
general excise or use tax on taxable sales into the State or comply with
certain general excise and use tax notice and reporting provisions.  This option is also available to other
persons, such as marketplace facilitators, for facilitated sales on behalf of
third-party remote sellers.

     SECTION 2.  Chapter 237, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
amended by adding two new sections to be appropriately designated and to read
as follows:

     "ยง237-A  Election by
remote sellers, referrers, and marketplace facilitators.  (a) 
Beginning on January 1, 2018, and for any calendar year thereafter,
remote sellers, referrers, and marketplace facilitators shall elect to collect
and remit general excise tax on all taxable sales into the State pursuant to
this chapter or comply with section 237-B.

     (b)  For marketplace facilitators, the
requirements of subsection (a) shall apply only with respect to:

     (1)  Retail sales
through the marketplace facilitator's marketplace by or on behalf of
marketplace sellers who do not have a physical presence in the State; and

     (2)  A marketplace

physical presence in the State.

     (c)  For referrers, the requirements of subsection

comply with the notice and reporting requirements of this section, and the seller
is not subject to the notice and reporting requirements of this section with
respect to those sales.  If a referrer
makes an election to comply with the applicable notice and reporting requirements

requirements pursuant to this section for their sales, unless the marketplace
seller collects the tax imposed under this chapter on taxable retail sales
sourced to the State.

     (b)  A seller, other than a referrer acting in its

     (3)  Instructions
for obtaining additional information from the department of taxation.

     By February 28 of each year, a
referrer required to provide notice pursuant to this subsection shall provide
the department with a list of sellers who received the referrer's notice under
this section and an affidavit signed under penalty of perjury from an officer

     (g)  A seller who is registered with the department
of taxation to collect and remit general excise tax, and who makes a reasonable
effort to comply with the requirements of this chapter, is not required to
provide notice or file reports under this section.

     (h)  Every seller subject to this section and
section 237-A shall keep and preserve, for a period of five years, suitable
records as may be necessary for the department of taxation to verify the
seller's compliance with this section and section 237-A.  All of the seller's books, records, and invoices
shall be open for examination at any reasonable time by the department of
taxation.  The department of taxation may
