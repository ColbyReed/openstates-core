     WHEREAS, for sixteen years, Act 228, Session Laws
of Hawaii (SLH) 2000, provided seriously ill individuals in the State of Hawaii
access to therapeutic benefits of medical marijuana; and

 

     WHEREAS, Act 228, SLH 2000, recognized the
existence of sufficient medical and anecdotal evidence to establish a record
that certain debilitating illnesses respond favorably to the medically
controlled use of marijuana; and

 

     WHEREAS, Act 241, SLH 2015, recognized that nearly
thirteen thousand patients in Hawaii would benefit from improved access to
controlled medical use of marijuana; and

 

WHEREAS, a regulated statewide
dispensary system was established to ensure the safe and legal access to
medical marijuana for qualifying patients; and

 

     WHEREAS, the majority of states have recognized
the medical benefits of medical marijuana and have legalized its use; and

 

WHEREAS, as of November 2016,
Hawaii, twenty-seven states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico
have legalized medical marijuana; and

 

     WHEREAS, the medical benefit of marijuana is
confirmed by sixteen years of controlled use in Hawaii and the growing number
of jurisdictions that have legalized medical marijuana; and

 

     WHEREAS, despite the proven record of beneficial
use, medical marijuana is still prohibited by federal law; and

WHEREAS, the United States
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) classifies marijuana in Schedule I, a
schedule for substances with no accepted medical use, under the Federal
Controlled Substances Act; and

 

     WHEREAS, in October 2009, in deference to the
states' legalization of medical marijuana, President Barack Obama's
administration encouraged federal prosecutors not to prosecute people who
distribute marijuana for medical purposes in accordance with state law; and

 

     WHEREAS, in August 2013, the United States
Department of Justice relaxed their marijuana enforcement policy, but they
complicated rather than resolved the issue; and

 

WHEREAS, marijuana remained
illegal under federal law, but if the states created strong, state-based
enforcement efforts, the Department of Justice would defer the federal right to
challenge the states' legalization laws; and

 

WHEREAS, the Department of
Justice, however, threatened federal prosecution and reserved the right to
challenge the states at any time the federal government felt it was necessary
to enforce the federal prohibition against marijuana; and

 

     WHEREAS, the shift in federal policy does not
resolve the continuing conflict between medical marijuana laws of the states
and the controlled substances law of the United States; and

 

WHEREAS, doctors, patients,
and marijuana dispensaries that grow, sell, transport, or prescribe marijuana
in compliance with Hawaii law are in jeopardy of arrest and sanctions under
federal law; and

 

WHEREAS, many banks and credit unions are unwilling
to do business with medical marijuana dispensaries since marijuana is
considered a controlled substance, resulting in many dispensaries becoming
cash-only businesses, thus increasing the risk of robbery and inhibiting the
ability of states to collect taxes; and

WHEREAS, the U.S. Postal Service and other shippers
are unable to transport marijuana without violating federal law; and

 

WHEREAS, cannabis advertisements are also prohibited
and considered "non-mailable" by the U.S. Postal Service because
marijuana is considered a controlled substance; and 

 

WHEREAS, state universities are unable to test or
conduct research on marijuana without fear of losing federal funding; and 

 

WHEREAS, on August 12, 2016,
the Drug Enforcement Administration denied two petitions to reschedule
marijuana to a more appropriate schedule on the Controlled Substances Act; and

 

WHEREAS, the first petition,
initiated on December 17, 2009, sought to remove marijuana from Schedule I and
reschedule it on any schedule other than Schedule I, 81 Fed. Reg. 53,767
(2016); and

 

WHEREAS, the second petition,
initiated on November 20, 2011, sought to remove marijuana from Schedule I and
reschedule it as medical cannabis on Schedule II, 81 Fed. Reg. 53,687 (2016);
now, therefore,

 

     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of
the Twenty-ninth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2017,
that this body requests that the United States Drug Enforcement Administration
reverse its August 12, 2016, denials of petitions, 81 Fed. Reg. 53,687 (2016)
and 81 Fed. Reg. 53,767 (2016), and reschedule marijuana to any schedule other
than Schedule I for purposes of the medically controlled use of marijuana in
accordance with state law; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a certified copy of
this Resolution be transmitted to the Administrator of the United States Drug
Enforcement Administration.
