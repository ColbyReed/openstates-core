     WHEREAS, in
times of national, state, and local emergencies, it is important for members of
the public to have timely and often life-saving information; and

 

     WHEREAS, the
Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service
work in conjunction to implement the Emergency Alert System at the federal
level; and

 

     WHEREAS, the
Emergency Alert System is a national public warning system that requires
broadcasters, cable television systems, wireless cable systems, satellite
digital audio radio service providers, and direct broadcast satellite providers
to provide the communications capability to the President to address the
American public during a national emergency; and

 

     WHEREAS, the
Emergency Alert System may also be used by state and local authorities to
deliver important emergency information targeted to specific areas; and

 

     WHEREAS, due
to deafness, hearing loss, or other reasons, many members of the public are not
always able to hear information from the Emergency Alert System, and therefore
need to receive that information in a textual form; and

 

     WHEREAS, it is
important that the textual information broadcasted on television from the Emergency
Alert System match and be synchronized with the broadcasted audible information,
which includes more details that the textual information; now, therefore,

 

     BE IT
RESOLVED by the Senate of the Twenty-ninth Legislature of the State of Hawaii,
Regular Session of 2018, the House of Representatives concurring, that the Federal
Communications Commission, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the
National Weather Service are urged to make necessary updates to ensure that
textual and audible information from the Emergency Alert System are matched and
synchronized during television broadcasts; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER
RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the
Chairperson of the Federal Communications Commission, the Administrator of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Director of the National Weather
Service, the Governor of Hawaii, and the Adjutant General of the State of
Hawaii.
