     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that section
291C-33, Hawaii Revised Statutes, relating to pedestrian-control signals, was
last amended in 1981.  This section needs to be updated to include countdown
timers and to clarify when a pedestrian is allowed to cross when the countdown
timer is operating.  Countdown timers show pedestrians how many seconds are
left to cross the street before the pedestrian signal changes from a flashing
"Don't Walk" to a steady "Don't Walk" or upraised palm
indication.

     SECTION 2.  Section 291C-33, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, is amended to read as follows:

     "ยง291C-33  Pedestrian-control signals. 
Whenever special pedestrian-control signals, exhibiting the words
"Walk" [or], "Don't Walk" or the symbols of a
walking person or an upraised palm, or a countdown timer are in place
such signals shall indicate as follows:

     (1)  Walk or Walking Person.  Pedestrians facing [such]
the signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal
and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles[.];

     (2)  Don't Walk or Upraised Palm.  No pedestrian shall
start to cross the roadway in the direction of [such] the signal,
whether flashing or steady, but any pedestrian who has partially completed the
pedestrian's crossing on the Walk or Walking Person signal shall complete the crossing
to a sidewalk or safety island while the Don't Walk or Upraised Palm signal is
showing[.]; and

     (3)  Countdown timer.  If the
pedestrian-control signal is equipped with a countdown timer, any pedestrian
who has partially completed the pedestrian's crossing while the countdown timer
is operating shall complete the crossing to a sidewalk or safety island while
the countdown timer is operating."

     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed
is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.




     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its
approval.
