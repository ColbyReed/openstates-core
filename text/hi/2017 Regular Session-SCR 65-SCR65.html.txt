as well as for any other historical, political, or personal reason; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that in the spirit of Aloha,
we reject any and all threats made to immigrants, whether as a consequence of

and specifically renounce the atrocity of the mass shooting in the Pulse
nightclub in Orlando, Florida in June 2016; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that we believe religious
freedom is one of this nation's most important founding principles, and will

cultural and historical commitment to honor and preserve our ‘aina, rejecting all
notions that climate change is a hoax, we respect and take heed of the findings
and advancements of scientific inquiry and the intent of public policy which

conserves and protects our natural environment; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that we will continue our
State's commitment to help ensure our residents have the necessary health care,

administration seeks to revoke health insurance from twenty million people, we
will work tirelessly to safeguard the health care of Hawaii residents already
guaranteed by this State; and

foster entrepreneurship and business in fair and just ways, with appropriate
regulation that protects consumers and promotes the vitality and economic
wealth of all in our community; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that because we are one of the
world's most sought after destinations, our Aloha Spirit is made stronger by
the thousands of international visitors we welcome every day, and thus remain
committed to internationalism and to our friends around the world; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that in the spirit of Aloha,
we commit to the aforementioned values, which make Hawaii the unique and
special place it is, so that we may serve as a positive role model for not only
the rest of the United States, but also for broad global alliances, other
nations, states, provinces, cities, communities, and for ourselves as
individuals - such as expressed by the "Spirit of Aloha" in section
5-7.5(a), Hawaii Revised Statutes, as "the coordination of mind and heart
within each person"; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this
Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the members of Hawaii's Congressional
