     WHEREAS, recent
headlines have brought increased attention to the issue of sexual harassment in
schools; and

 

     WHEREAS, the
relationship between a student and a trusted adult such as a teacher, coach, or
other school employee is an inherently uneven one, where the student is often
susceptible to undue influence and pressure; and

 

     WHEREAS, it
is necessary to ensure that all students in the State are protected from sexual
harassment of any kind; and

 

     WHEREAS,
according to the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission, "Prevention is the best
tool for the elimination of sexual harassment.  Employers should affirmatively raise the
subject, express strong disapproval, develop appropriate sanctions, inform
employees of their right to raise and how to raise the issue of sexual
harassment, and take any other steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment
from occurring"; and

 

     WHEREAS, the
Department of Education's Code of Conduct expressly prohibits employees,
contractors, and volunteers from "committing any abusive act or sexual
exploitation with, to, or in the presence of a student," regardless of
whether the student is or has been under the care or supervision of that
employee, contractor, or volunteer; and

 

     WHEREAS, the
Department of Education's Code of Conduct further prohibits any sexual act, any
solicitation of a sexual act, any act of sexual harassment, or any intentional
solicitation, encouragement, or consummation of a romantic or physical
relationship with a student, or any sexual contact with a student; and

 

     WHEREAS, this
body believes that the Department of Education's existing policies should be
reviewed by an independent entity to ensure that the policies are sufficient to
ensure the safety and protection of all students under the care of the public
schools; now, therefore,

 

     BE IT RESOLVED
by the Senate of the Twenty-ninth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular
Session of 2018, that the Department of the Attorney General is requested to:

 

     (1)  Review the Department of Education's policies
on sexual harassment, including its policies on training for employees,
contractors, and volunteers; 

 

     (2)  Include in the review an assessment of whether
the Department of Education's current policies and training are sufficient; 

 

     (3)  Determine the correlation, if any, between
additional training and instances of reported sexual harassment; 

 

     (4)  Review relevant sexual harassment policies and
training procedures used in the State's private schools to determine what
practices used at private schools may be integrated into public schools;

 

     (5)  Recommend potential improvements to the
Department of Education's policies and training; and

 

     (6)  Report its findings and recommendations,
including any proposed legislation, to this body no later than twenty days
prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2019; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER
RESOLVED that the Department of Education, Hawaii Association of Independent
Schools, their staff, and other relevant persons, agencies, and entities are
requested to cooperate and assist the Department of the Attorney General as
needed, and to provide any information requested by the Department of the
Attorney General; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER
RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the
Attorney General, Chairperson of the Board of Education, Superintendent of
Education, and Executive Director of the Hawaii Association of Independent
Schools.
