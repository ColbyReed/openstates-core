     WHEREAS, students
typically spend up to eight hours per day at school; and

 

     WHEREAS, it
is foreseeable that, if a natural disaster occurs, such as a major storm,
earthquake, or flood, students may be trapped at their respective school
campuses for extended periods of time; and

 

     WHEREAS, man-made
emergencies, such as the September 5, 2006, incident in which a military vehicle
collided with a pedestrian overpass in Aiea, forcing the State to close six
lanes of the H-1 Freeway for thirteen hours, can also stall the ability of
students to reach home; and

 

     WHEREAS, students
who are at school for extended periods of time need access to food; and

 

     WHEREAS,
although public schools are usually equipped to provide prepared meals to
students at scheduled mealtimes, they do not always have the resources to
provide meals to students when emergencies occur; and

 

     WHEREAS, a
Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE), is an individual field ration that provides a full meal
in a sealed package and typically has a storage life of three years or longer;
and

 

     WHEREAS, members
of the military often consume MREs when normal food facilities are not
available; and

 

     WHEREAS, MREs
are also suitable for consumption by young children, especially when disasters or
other emergencies prevent their parents from picking them up from school; now,
therefore,

 

     BE IT
RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-ninth Legislature of the
State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2018, the Senate concurring, that the
Department of Education is requested to supply each public school student
enrolled in kindergarten through sixth grade with one MRE; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER
RESOLVED that the Department of Education is requested to instruct students who
receive MREs to keep their MREs on hand, and only consume the MREs if a natural
disaster  or other emergency incident
occurs, to teach the students lessons on disaster preparedness; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER
RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the
Chairperson of the Board of Education and the Superintendent of Education.
