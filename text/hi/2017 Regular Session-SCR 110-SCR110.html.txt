     WHEREAS, the State has designated a state song, flower,
gem, tree, land mammal, marine mammal, fish, dance, insect, sport, team sport
and instrument; and

 

     WHEREAS, there is no state beverage even though
more than half of the states in the U.S. have official beverages; and

 

     WHEREAS, designation of an official state beverage
should serve as an expression of appreciation for the significance of that
beverage in the Hawaiian culture; and

 

     WHEREAS, the plant roots of Piper methysticum
have been used to make the beverage, 'awa, here in Hawaii since before European
contact; and

 

     WHEREAS, the best state for cultivating Piper
methysticum is Hawaii due to the state's sunny, humid conditions and year
round warm temperatures; and

 

     WHEREAS, the residents of this state, including
the kanaka maoli, Hawaii's indigenous peoples, recognize 'awa as an important
traditional and cultural beverage; and

 

     WHEREAS, drinking 'awa promotes "aloha"
by eliciting a feeling of relaxed contentedness and aids in discussion and
conflict resolution; and

 

     WHEREAS, 'awa symbolizes the environmental, social
and cultural values important to Hawaii; and

 

     WHEREAS, it is time to formally recognize 'awa's
historical and cultural significance to the state and its peoples; now,
therefore,

 

     BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the Twenty-ninth
Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2017, the House of
Representatives concurring, that the Hawaii State legislation declare 'awa to
be the official beverage of the aloha state; and

 

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of
this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Governor and the Chairperson
of the board of trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.
