A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
STATING FINDINGS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND ENCOURAGING THE IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF
HEALTH AND WELFARE TO CONDUCT TOWN HALL MEETINGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO
COLLECT FEEDBACK ON HOW TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT VOLUNTEER EMERGENCY MEDI-
CAL SERVICES PROVIDERS.
Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
WHEREAS, Idaho is predominantly a rural state that relies heavily on
volunteers for the provision of emergency medical services (EMS); and
WHEREAS, the existence of competent volunteer EMS providers throughout
Idaho is vital to the well-being of all those who live in or visit Idaho; and
WHEREAS, the requirements placed on volunteer EMS providers must pro-
vide an assurance of public safety while not being onerous to the point that
volunteer participation is discouraged; and
WHEREAS, in 2012, at the request of the Legislature, the Idaho Depart-
ment of Health and Welfare conducted a series of outreach town hall meetings
throughout the state that provided feedback and suggestions for improvement
in the programs, policies, plans and procedures that support and regulate
emergency medical services in Idaho.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the Second Regular
Session of the Sixty-fourth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of
Representatives concurring therein, that the Legislature encourages the
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to conduct follow-up town hall meet-
ings throughout Idaho to collect firsthand feedback on the progress that has
been made in the years since the initial outreach town hall meetings.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department should schedule the town hall
meetings in the evening hours to enable maximum participation by concerned
stakeholders and should hold the town hall meetings in locations that will
enable concerned stakeholders to attend without having to drive farther than
50 miles whenever possible.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department should facilitate the town
hall meetings in such a manner as to gather as much feedback and suggestions
for improvement as possible and should consider the feedback received during
the town hall meetings as the Department continues to develop the programs,
policies, plans and procedures that support and regulate emergency medical
services in Idaho.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that members of the Legislature are encouraged to
attend town hall meetings in their districts in order to hear the firsthand
feedback and to participate in the discussion.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that EMS stakeholders from local communities are
encouraged to attend and actively participate in a town hall meeting in their
area.
