AN ACT
RELATING TO SALES UNDER EXECUTION; AMENDING SECTION 11-304, IDAHO CODE, TO
REVISE PROVISIONS REGARDING HOW SALES ARE CONDUCTED.
Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
SECTION 1. That Section 11-304, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
amended to read as follows:
11-304. CONDUCT OF SALE. All sales of property under execution must be
made at auction, to the highest bidder, between the hours of nine (9:00) in
the morning and five (5:00) in the afternoon. After sufficient property has
been sold to satisfy the execution, no more can be sold. Neither the officer
holding the execution nor his deputy can become a purchaser, or be interested
in any purchase, at such sale. When the sale is of personal property, capable
of manual delivery, it must be within view of those who attend the sale, and
be sold in such parcels as are likely to bring the highest price; and when the
sale is of real property, consisting of several known lots or parcels, they
must be sold separately, or when a portion of such real property is claimed by
a third person, and he requires it to be sold separately, such portion must be
thus sold. The judgment debtor, if present at the sale, may also direct the
order in which property, real or personal, shall be sold, when such property
consists of several known lots or parcels, or of articles which can be sold to
advantage separately, and the sheriff must follow such directions.
