35-8A-210(c) identified appropriately, unless the development
rights are adequately described in the declaration.
"(e) Unless the declaration provides otherwise, the
horizontal boundaries of any part of a unit located outside of
a building have the same elevation as the horizontal
boundaries of the inside part the building, and need not be
depicted on the plats and plans.
"(f) Upon exercising any development right that
affects the condominium property, the declarant shall record
either new plats and plans necessary to conform to the
requirements of subsections (a), (b), and (d) above, or new
certifications of the plats and plans previously recorded if
those plats and plans otherwise conform to the requirements of
those subsections.
"(g) Any certification of a plat or plan required by
this section or Section 35-8A-201(b) must be made by an
independent a registered engineer or, a registered architect,
or a licensed surveyor.
"ยง35-8A-210.
"(a) To exercise any development right reserved
under Section 35-8A-205(a)(8), the declarant shall prepare,
execute, and record an amendment to the declaration as
specified in Section 35-8A-217 and comply with Section
35-8A-209. The declarant is the unit owner of any units
thereby created. The amendment to the declaration must assign
an identifying number to each new unit created, and, except in
the case of subdivision or conversion of units described in
subsection (b) subdivision (2) of subsection (c), reallocate
the allocated interests among all units. The amendment must
describe any common elements and any limited common elements
thereby created and, in the case of limited common elements,
designate the unit to which each is allocated to the extent
required by Section 35-8A-208.
"(b) Development rights may be reserved within any
real estate added to the condominium if the amendment adding
that real estate includes all matters required by Section
35-8A-205 or 35-8A-206, as the case may be, and the plats and
plans include all matters required by Section 35-8A-209. This
provision does not extend the time limit on the exercise of
development rights imposed by the declaration pursuant to
Section 35-8A-205(a)(8).
"(c) Whenever a declarant exercises a development
right to subdivide or convert a unit previously created into
additional units, common elements, or both:
"(1) If the declarant converts the unit entirely to
common elements, the amendment to the declaration must
reallocate all the allocated interests of that unit among the
other units as if that unit had been taken by eminent domain;
and
"(2) If the declarant subdivides the unit into two
or more units, whether or not any part of the unit is
converted into common elements, the amendment to the
declaration must reallocate all the allocated interests of the
unit among the units created by the subdivision in any
reasonable manner prescribed by the declarant.
"(d) If the declaration provides, pursuant to
Section 35-8A-205(a)(8), that all or a portion of the real
estate is subject to the development right of withdrawal:
"(1) If all the real estate is subject to
withdrawal, and the declaration does not describe separate
portions of real estate subject to that right, none of the
real estate may be withdrawn after a unit has been conveyed to
a purchaser; and
"(2) If a portion or portions are subject to
withdrawal, no portion may be withdrawn after a unit in that
portion has been conveyed to a purchaser.
"ยง35-8A-211.
"Subject to the provisions of the declaration and
other provisions of law, a unit owner:
"(1) May make any improvements or alterations to his
or her unit that do not impair the structural integrity, or
mechanical systems, or lessen the support of any portion of
the condominium;
"(2) May not substantially or adversely change the
appearance of the common elements, or the exterior appearance
of a unit or any other portion of the condominium, without
permission of the association;
"(3) After acquiring an adjoining unit, or an
adjoining part of an adjoining unit, may remove or alter any
intervening partition or create apertures therein, even if the
partition in whole or in part is a common element, if those
acts do not impair the structural integrity or mechanical
systems or lessen the support of any portion of the
condominium. Removal of partitions or creation of apertures
under this subdivision is not an alteration of boundaries.
"ยง35-8A-214.
"The existing physical boundaries of a unit or the
physical boundaries of a unit reconstructed in substantial
accordance with the original plats and plans thereof become
its boundaries rather than the metes and bounds expressed in
the deed or plat or plan, regardless of settling or lateral
movement of the building, or minor variance between boundaries
shown on the plats or plans or in the deed and those of the
building. This section does not relieve a unit owner of
liability in case of his or her willful misconduct nor relieve
a declarant or any other person of liability for failure to
adhere to the plats and plans.
"ยง35-8A-215.
"A declarant may maintain sales offices, management
offices, and models in units or on common elements in the
condominium only if the declaration so provides and specifies
the rights of a declarant with regard to the number, size,
location, and relocation thereof. Any sales office, management
office, or model not designated a unit by the declaration is a
common element, and if a declarant ceases to be a unit owner,
he or she ceases to have any rights with regard thereto unless
it is removed promptly from the condominium in accordance with
a right to remove reserved in the declaration. Subject to any
limitations in the declaration, a declarant may maintain signs
on the common elements advertising the condominium. The
provisions of this section are subject to the provisions of
other state law, and to local ordinances.
"ยง35-8A-218.
"(a) Except in the case of a taking of all the units
by eminent domain specified in Section 35-8A-107, a
condominium may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners
of units to which at least 80 percent of the votes in the
association are allocated, or any larger percentage the
declaration specifies. The declaration may specify a smaller
percentage only if all of the units in the condominium are
restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.
"(b) An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by
the execution of a termination agreement, or ratifications
thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number
of unit owners. The termination agreement must specify a date
after which the agreement will be void unless it is recorded
before that date. A termination agreement and all
ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in
which a portion of the condominium is situated, and is
effective only upon recordation.
"(c) In the case of a condominium containing only
units having horizontal boundaries described in the
declaration, a termination agreement may provide that all the
common elements and units of the condominium shall be sold
following termination. If, pursuant to the agreement, any real
estate in the condominium is to be sold following termination,
the termination agreement must set forth the minimum terms of
the sale.
"(d) In the case of a condominium containing any
units not having horizontal boundaries described in the
declaration, a termination agreement may provide for sale of
the common elements, but may not require that the units be
sold following termination, unless the declaration as
originally recorded provided otherwise or unless all the unit
owners consent to the sale.
"(e) The association, on behalf of the unit owners,
may contract for the sale of real estate in the condominium,
but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until
approved pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). If any real
estate in the condominium is to be sold following termination,
title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the
association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the
units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary
and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been
concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the
association continues in existence with all powers it had
before termination. Proceeds of the sale must be distributed
to unit owners and lien holders as their interests may appear,
in accordance with subsections (i), (j), and (k). Unless
otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as
the association holds title to the real estate, each unit
owner and his or her successors in interest have an exclusive
right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that
formerly constituted his or her unit. During the period of
that occupancy, each unit owner and his or her successors in
interest remain liable for all assessments and other
obligations imposed on unit owners by this chapter or the
declaration.
"(f) If the real estate constituting the condominium
is not to be sold following termination, title to the common
elements and, in a condominium containing only units having
horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, title to
all the real estate in the condominium, vests in the unit
owners upon termination as tenants in common in proportion to
their respective interests as provided in subsection (h), and
liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in
common exists, each unit owner and his or her successors in
interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion
of the real estate that formerly constituted his or her unit.
"(g) Following termination of the condominium, the
proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets
of the association, are held by the association as trustee for
unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their
interests may appear.
"(h) Following termination, creditors of the
association holding liens on the units which were recorded
before termination, may enforce those liens in the same manner
as any lien holder. All other creditors of the association are
to be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units
immediately before termination.
"(i) The respective interests of unit owners
referred to in subsections (e), (f), (g), and (h) are as
follows:
"(1) Except as provided in subdivision (2), the
respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values
of their units, limited common elements, and common element
interests immediately before the termination, as determined by
one or more independent appraisers selected by the
association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall
be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless
disapproved within 30 days after distribution by unit owners
of units to which 25 percent of the votes in the association
are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner's interest to
that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair
market value of that unit and common element interest by the
total fair market values of all the units and common elements.
"(2) If any unit or any limited common element is
destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market
value thereof before destruction cannot be made, the interests
of all unit owners are their respective common element
interests immediately before the termination.
"(j) Except as provided in subsection (k),
foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against
the entire condominium does not of itself terminate the
condominium, and foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or
encumbrance against a portion of the condominium, other than
withdrawable real estate, does not withdraw that portion from
the condominium. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or
encumbrance against withdrawable real estate does not of
itself withdraw that real estate from the condominium, but the
person taking title thereto has the right to require from the
association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real
estate from the condominium.
"(k) If a lien or encumbrance against a portion of
the real estate comprising the condominium has priority over
the declaration, and the lien or encumbrance has not been
partially released, the parties foreclosing the lien or
encumbrance may upon foreclosure, record an instrument
excluding the real estate subject to that lien or encumbrance
from the condominium.
"ยง35-8A-220.
"(a) If the declaration for a condominium provides
that any of the powers described in Section 35-8A-302 are to
be exercised by or may be delegated to a profit or nonprofit
corporation which exercises those or other powers on behalf of
one or more condominiums or for the benefit of the unit owners
of one or more condominiums, all provisions of this chapter
applicable to unit owners' associations apply to any such
corporation with regard to such delegated power except as
modified by this section.
"(b) Unless it is acting in the capacity of an
association described in Section 35-8A-301, a master
association may exercise the powers set forth in Section
35-8A-302(a)(2) only to the extent expressly permitted in the
declarations of condominiums which are part of the master
association or expressly described in the delegations of power
from those condominiums to the master association.
"(c) If the declaration of any condominium provides
that the board may delegate certain powers to a master
association, the members of the board have no liability for
the acts or omissions of the master association with respect
to those powers following delegation.
"(d) The rights and responsibilities of unit owners
with respect to the unit owners' association set forth in
Sections 35-8A-303, 35-8A-308 through 35-8A-310, and 35-8A-312
apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association
only to those persons who elect the board of a master
association, whether or not those persons are otherwise unit
owners within the meaning of this chapter.
"(e) Even if a master association is also an
association described in Section 35-8A-301, the certificate of
incorporation or other instrument creating the master
association and the declaration of each condominium the powers
of which are assigned by the declaration or delegated to the
master association, may provide that the executive board of
the master association must be elected after the period of
declarant control in any of the following ways:
"(1) All unit owners of all condominiums subject to
the master association may elect all members of that executive
board.
"(2) All members of the executive boards of all
condominiums subject to the master association may elect all
members of that executive board.
"(3) All unit owners of each condominium subject to
the master association may elect specified members of that
executive board.
"(4) All members of the executive board of each
condominium subject to the master association may elect
specified members of that executive board.
"ยง35-8A-302.
"(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), and
subject to the provisions of the declaration, the association
may:
"(1) Adopt and amend bylaws and rules and
regulations, except that an association may not adopt a bylaw
or enforce an existing bylaw to restrict an owner from
renovating or decorating the interior walls, ceiling, or floor
of his or her unit in a manner that does not substantially
alter the exterior appearance of the condominium;
"(2) Adopt and amend budgets for revenues,
expenditures, and reserves and impose and collect assessments
for common expenses from unit owners;
"(3) Hire and discharge managing agents and other
employees, agents, and independent contractors;
"(4) Institute, defend, or intervene in litigation
or administrative proceedings in its own name on behalf of
itself or two or more unit owners on matters affecting the
condominium;
"(5) Make contracts and incur liabilities;
"(6) Regulate the use, maintenance, repair,
replacement, and modification of common elements;
"(7) Cause additional improvements to be made as a
part of the common elements;
"(8) Acquire, hold, encumber, and convey in its own
name any right, title, or interest to real or personal
property, but interests in the common elements other than
those set forth in subdivision (9) may be conveyed or
subjected to a security interest only pursuant to Section
35-8A-312;
"(9) Grant easements, encroachments, leases,
licenses, and concessions through or over the common elements;
"(10) Impose and receive any payments, fees, or
charges for the use, rental, or operation of the common
elements, other than limited common elements described in
Section 35-8A-202(2) and (4), and for services provided to
unit owners;
"(11) Impose against owners of units charges for
late payment of assessments and, after notice and an
opportunity to be heard, levy reasonable fines for violations
of the declaration, bylaws, and rules and regulations of the
association;
"(12) Impose reasonable charges for the preparation
and recordation of amendments to the declaration, resale
certificates required by Section 35-8A-409, or statements of
unpaid assessments;
"(13) Provide for the indemnification of its
officers and board and maintain directors' and officers'
liability insurance;
"(14) Assign its right to future income, including
the right to receive common expense assessments, but only to
the extent the declaration expressly so provides, or as
required to secure a loan that is otherwise allowed or
provided for in the governing documents;
"(15) Exercise any other powers conferred by the
declaration or bylaws;
"(16) Exercise all other powers that may be
exercised in this state by legal entities of the same type as
the association; and
"(17) Exercise any other powers necessary and proper
for the governance and operation of the association.
"(b) The declaration may not impose limitations on
the power of the association to deal with the declarant which
are more restrictive than the limitations imposed on the power
of the association to deal with other persons.
"ยง35-8A-303.
"(a) Except as provided in the declaration, the
bylaws, the articles of incorporation in subsection (b), or
other provisions of this chapter, the board may act in all
instances on behalf of the association. In the performance of
their duties, the officers and members of the board are
required to exercise (i) if appointed by the declarant, the
care required of fiduciaries of the unit owners other than the
declarant and (ii) if elected by the unit owners other than
declarant, ordinary and reasonable care.
"(b) The board may not act on behalf of the
association to amend the declaration as specified in Section
35-8A-217, to terminate the condominium described in Section
35-8A-218, or to elect members of the board or to determine
the qualifications, powers and duties, or terms of office of
board members as provided in Section 35-8A-303(f), but the
board may fill vacancies in its membership for the unexpired
portion of any term.
"(c) Within 30 days after adoption of any proposed
budget for the condominium, the board shall provide a copy of
the budget to all the unit owners, and shall set a date for a
meeting of the unit owners to consider ratification of the
budget not less than 14 10 nor more than 30 50 days after
delivery or mailing of the budget to the unit owners. Unless
at that meeting a majority of all the unit owners present in
person or by proxy or any larger vote specified in the
declaration reject the budget, the budget is ratified, whether
or not a quorum is present. In the event the proposed budget
is rejected, the periodic budget last ratified by the unit
owners shall be continued until such time as the unit owners
ratify a subsequent budget proposed by the board.
"(d) Subject to subsection (e), the declaration may
provide for a period of declarant control of the association,
during which period a declarant, or persons designated by him
or her, may appoint and remove the officers and members of the
board. Regardless of the period provided in the declaration, a
period of declarant control terminates no later than the
earliest of (i) 60 days after conveyance of 75 percent of the
units which may be created to unit owners other than a
declarant; (ii) two years after all declarants have ceased to
offer units for sale in the ordinary course of business; or
(iii) two years after any development right to add new units
was last exercised. A declarant may voluntarily surrender the
right to appoint and remove officers and members of the board
before termination of that period, but in that event he or she
may require, for the duration of the period of declarant
control, that specified actions of the association or board,
as described in a recorded instrument executed by the
declarant, be approved by the declarant before they become
effective.
"(e) Not later than 90 days after conveyance of 25
percent of the units which may be created to unit owners other
than a declarant, at least one member and not less than 25
percent of the members of the board must be elected by unit
owners other than the declarant. Not later than 90 days after
conveyance of 50 percent of the units which may be created to
unit owners other than a declarant, not less than 33 1/3
percent of the members of the board must be elected by unit
owners other than the declarant.
"(f) Except as otherwise provided in Section
35-8A-220(e), not later than the termination of any period of
declarant control, the unit owners shall elect a board of at
least three members, at least a majority of whom must be unit
owners other than declarant. The board shall elect the
officers. The board members and officers shall take office
upon election.
"(g) Notwithstanding any provision of the
declaration or bylaws to the contrary, the unit owners, by a
two-thirds vote of all persons present in person and entitled
to vote at any meeting of the unit owners at which a quorum in
person is present, may remove any member of the board with or
without cause, other than a member appointed by the declarant.
"ยง35-8A-304.
"(a) No special declarant right specified in Section
35-8A-103(24) created or reserved under this chapter may be
transferred except by an instrument evidencing the transfer
recorded in every county in which any portion of the
condominium is located. The instrument is not effective unless
executed by the transferor and the transferee in the same
formality as a conveyance of real property.
"(b) Upon transfer of any special declarant right,
the liability of a transferor declarant is as follows:
"(1) A transferor is not relieved of any obligation
or liability arising before the transfer and remains liable
for warranty obligations imposed upon him or her by this
chapter. Lack of privity does not deprive any unit owner of
standing to maintain an action to enforce any obligation of
the transferor.
"(2) If a successor to any special declarant right
is an affiliate of a declarant specified in Section
35-8A-103(1), the transferor is jointly and severally liable
with the successor for any obligations or liabilities of the
successor relating to the condominium.
"(3) If a transferor retains any special declarant
right, but transfers other special declarant rights to a
successor who is not an affiliate of the declarant, the
transferor is liable for any obligations or liabilities
imposed on a declarant by this chapter or by the declaration
relating to the retained special declarant rights and arising
after the transfer.
"(4) A transferor has no liability for any act or
omission or any breach of a contractual or warranty obligation
arising from the exercise of a special declarant right by a
successor declarant who is not an affiliate of the transferor.
"(c) Unless otherwise provided in a mortgage
instrument or deed of trust or other agreement creating a
security interest, in case of foreclosure of a security
interest, sale by a trustee under an agreement creating a
security interest, tax sale, judicial sale, or sale under
federal bankruptcy law or receivership proceedings, of any
units owned by a declarant or real estate in a condominium
subject to development rights, a person acquiring title to all
the real estate being foreclosed or sold succeeds to all
special declarant rights related to that real estate held by
that declarant, or only to any rights reserved in the
declaration pursuant to Section 35-8A-215 and held by that
declarant to maintain models, sales offices and signs.
"(d) Upon foreclosure of a security interest, sale
by a trustee under an agreement creating a security interest,
tax sale, judicial sale, or sale under federal bankruptcy law
or receivership proceedings, of all units and other real
estate in a condominium owned by a declarant:
"(1) The declarant ceases to have any special
declarant rights, and
"(2) The period of declarant control specified in
Section 35-8A-303(d) terminates unless the judgment or
instrument conveying title provides for transfer of all
special declarant rights held by that declarant to a successor
declarant.
"(e) The liabilities and obligations of a person who
succeeds to special declarant rights are as follows:
"(1) A successor to any special declarant right who
is an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations
and liabilities imposed on the transferor by this chapter or
by the declaration.
"(2) A successor to any special declarant right,
other than a successor described in subdivisions (3) or (4),
who is not an affiliate of a declarant, is subject to all
obligations and liabilities imposed by this chapter or the
declaration:
"a. On a declarant which relates to his or her
exercise or nonexercise of special declarant rights; or
"b. On his or her transferor, other than:
"1. Misrepresentations by any previous declarant;
"2. Warranty obligations on improvements made by any
previous declarant, or made before the condominium was
created;
"3. Breach of any fiduciary obligation by any
previous declarant or his or her appointees to the board; or
"4. Any liability or obligation imposed on the
transferor as a result of the transferor's acts or omissions
after the transfer.
"(3) A successor to only a right reserved in the
declaration to maintain models, sales offices, and signs
pursuant to Section 35-8A-215, may not exercise any other
special declarant right, and is not subject to any liability
or obligation as a declarant, except the obligation to provide
an offering statement and any liability arising as a result
thereof.
"(4) A successor to all special declarant rights
held by his or her transferor who is not an affiliate of that
declarant and who succeeded to those rights pursuant to a deed
in lieu of foreclosure or a judgment or instrument conveying
title to units under subsection (c), may declare the intention
in a recorded instrument to hold those rights solely for
transfer to another person. Thereafter, until transferring all
special declarant rights to any person acquiring title to any
unit owned by the successor, or until recording an instrument
permitting exercise of all those rights, that successor may
not exercise any of those rights other than any right held by
his or her transferor to control the board in accordance with
the provisions of Section 35-8A-303(d) for the duration of any
period of declarant control, and any attempted exercise of
those rights is void. So long as a successor declarant may not
exercise special declarant rights under this subsection, he or
she is not subject to any liability or obligation as a
declarant other than liability for his or her acts and
omissions under Section 35-8A-303(d).
"(f) Nothing in this section subjects any successor
to a special declarant right to any claims against or other
obligations of a transferor declarant, other than claims and
obligations arising under this chapter or the declaration.
"ยง35-8A-305.
"If entered into before the board elected by the
unit owners pursuant to Section 35-8A-303(f) takes office, (i)
any management contract, employment contract, or lease of
recreational or parking areas or facilities, (ii) any other
contract or lease between the association and a declarant or
an affiliate of a declarant, or (iii) any contract or lease
that is not bona fide or was unconscionable to the unit owners
at the time entered into under the circumstances then
prevailing, may be terminated without penalty by the
association at any time during the current term of the
contract or lease after the board elected by the unit owners
pursuant to Section 35-8A-303(f) takes office upon not less
than 90 days' notice to the other party. This section does not
apply to any lease the termination of which would terminate
the condominium or reduce its size, unless the real estate
subject to that lease was included in the condominium for the
purpose of avoiding the right of the association to terminate
a lease under this section.
"ยง35-8A-307.
"(a) Except to the extent provided by the
declaration, subsection (b), or Section 35-8A-313(h), the
association is responsible for maintenance, repair, and
replacement of the common elements, and each unit owner is
responsible for maintenance, repair, and replacement of his or
her unit. Each unit owner shall afford to the association and
the other unit owners, and to their agents or employees,
access through his or her unit reasonably necessary for those
purposes. If damage is inflicted on the common elements, or on
any unit through which access is taken, the unit owner
responsible for the damage, or the association if it is
responsible, is liable for the prompt repair thereof.
"(b) In addition to the liability that a declarant
as a unit owner has under this chapter, the declarant alone is
liable for all expenses in connection with real estate subject
to development rights. No other unit owner and no other
portion of the condominium is subject to a claim for payment
of those expenses. Unless the declaration provides otherwise,
any income or proceeds from real estate subject to development
rights inures to the declarant.
"ยง35-8A-310.
"(a) If only one of the multiple owners of a unit is
present at a meeting of the association, he or she is entitled
to cast all the votes allocated to that unit. If more than one
of the multiple owners are present, the votes allocated to
that unit may be cast only in accordance with the agreement of
a majority in interest of the multiple owners, unless either
the declaration or bylaws expressly provides otherwise. There
is majority agreement if any one of the multiple owners casts
the votes allocated to that unit without protest being made
promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by any of
the other owners of the unit.
"(b) Votes allocated to a unit may be cast pursuant
to a proxy duly executed by the unit owner except as provided
in Section 35-8A-303(g). If a unit is owned by more than one
person, each owner of the unit may vote or register protest to
the casting of votes by the other owners of the unit through a
duly executed proxy. A unit owner may not revoke a proxy given
pursuant to this section except by actual notice of revocation
to the person presiding over a meeting of the association. A
proxy is void if it is not dated or purports to be revocable
without notice. A proxy terminates one year after its date,
unless it specifies a shorter term.
"(c) If the declaration requires that votes on
specified matters affecting the condominium be cast by lessees
rather than unit owners of leased units: (i) the provisions of
subsection subsections (a) and (b) apply to lessees as if they
were unit owners; (ii) unit owners who have leased their units
to other persons may not cast votes on those specified
matters; and (iii) lessees are entitled to notice of meetings,
access to records, and other rights respecting those matters
as if they were unit owners. Unit owners must also be given
notice, in the manner provided in Section 35-8A-308, of all
meetings at which lessees may be entitled to vote.
"(d) No votes allocated to a unit owned by the
association may be cast.
"ยง35-8A-311.
"Neither the association, any association mortgagee,
nor any unit owner except the declarant is liable for that
declarant's torts in connection with any part of the
condominium which that declarant has the responsibility to
maintain. Otherwise, an action alleging a wrong done by the
association shall be brought against the association and not
against any unit owner. If the wrong occurred during any
period of declarant control and the association gives the
declarant reasonable notice of and an opportunity to defend
against the action, the declarant who then controlled the
association is liable to the association or to any unit owner:
(i) for all tort losses not covered by insurance suffered by
the association or that unit owner, and (ii) for all costs
which the association would not have incurred but for a breach
of contract or other wrongful act or omission. Whenever the
declarant is liable to the association under this section, the
declarant is also liable for all reasonable litigation
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by the
association. Any statute of limitation affecting the
association's right of action under this section is tolled
until the period of declarant control terminates. A unit owner
is not precluded from bringing an action contemplated by this
section solely because he or she is a unit owner, or a member
or officer of the association. Liens resulting from judgments
against the association are governed by Section 35-8A-317.

"(a) In a condominium portions of the common
elements may be conveyed or subjected to a security interest
by the association if persons entitled to cast at least 80
percent of the votes in the association, including 80 percent
of the votes allocated to units not owned by a declarant, or
any larger percentage the declaration specifies, agree to that
action; but all the owners of units to which any limited
common element is allocated must agree in order to convey that
limited common element or subject it to a security interest.
The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all
of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential
uses. Proceeds of the sale or loan are an asset of the
association.
"(b) An agreement to convey common elements in a
condominium or subject them to a security interest must be
evidenced by the execution of an agreement, or ratifications
thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number
of unit owners. The agreement must specify a date after which
the agreement will be void unless recorded before that date.
The agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded
in every county in which a portion of the condominium is
situated, and is effective only upon recordation.
"(c) The association, on behalf of the unit owners,
may contract to convey an interest in a condominium pursuant
to subsection (a), but the contract is not enforceable against
the association until approved pursuant to subsections (a) and
(b). Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and
appropriate to effect the conveyance or encumbrance, including
the power to execute deeds or other instruments.
"(d) Any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial
sale or other voluntary transfer of common elements, unless
made pursuant to this section, is void.
"(e) A conveyance or encumbrance of common elements
pursuant to this section does not deprive any unit of its
rights of access and support.
"(f) Unless the declaration otherwise provides, a
conveyance or encumbrance of common elements pursuant to this
section does not affect the priority or validity of
pre-existing encumbrances.
"ยง35-8A-313.
"(a) Commencing not later than the time of the first
conveyance of a unit to a person other than a declarant, the
association shall maintain, to the extent reasonably
available:
"(1) Property insurance on the common elements
insuring against all risks of direct physical loss commonly
insured against or, in the case of a conversion building,
against fire and extended coverage perils. The total amount of
insurance after application of any deductibles shall be not
less than the greater of 80 percent of the actual cash value
of the insured property at the time the insurance is purchased
or such greater percentage of such actual cash value as may be
necessary to prevent the applicability of any co-insurance
provision and at each renewal date, exclusive of land,
excavations, foundations and other items normally excluded
from property policies; and
"(2) Liability insurance, including medical payments
insurance, in an amount determined by the board but not less
than any amount specified in the declaration, covering all
occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury,
and property damage arising out of or in connection with the
use, ownership, or maintenance of the common elements.
"(b) In the case of a building containing units
having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, the
insurance maintained under subdivision (a)(1), to the extent
reasonably available, must include the units, but need not
include improvements and betterments installed by unit owners.
"(c) If the insurance described in subsections (a)
and (b) is not reasonably available, the association promptly
shall cause notice of that fact to be hand-delivered or sent
prepaid by United States mail to all unit owners. The
declaration may require the association to carry any other
insurance, and the association in any event may carry any
other insurance it deems appropriate to protect the
association or the unit owners.
"(d) Insurance policies carried pursuant to
subsection (a) must provide that:
"(1) Each unit owner is an insured person under the
policy with respect to liability arising out of his or her
interest in the common elements or membership in the
association;
"(2) The insurer waives its right to subrogation
under the policy against any unit owner or member of his or
her household;
"(3) No act or omission by any unit owner, unless
acting within the scope of his or her authority on behalf of
the association, will void the policy or be a condition to
recovery under the policy; and
"(4) If, at the time of a loss under the policy,
there is other insurance in the name of a unit owner covering
the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy
provides primary insurance.
"(e) Any loss covered by the property policy under
subsections (a)(1) and (b) must be adjusted with the
association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss are
payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose,
or otherwise to the association, and not to any holder of a
security interest. The insurance trustee or the association
shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for unit owners and
lien holders as their interests may appear. Subject to the
provisions of subsection (h), the proceeds must be disbursed
first for the repair or restoration of the damaged property,
and the association unit owners and lien holders are not
entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds
unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has
been completely repaired or restored, or the condominium is
terminated.
"(f) An insurance policy issued to the association
does not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for his
or her own benefit.
"(g) An insurer that has issued an insurance policy
under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of
insurance to the association and, upon written request, to any
unit owner, or holder of a security interest. The insurer
issuing the policy may not cancel or refuse to renew it until
30 days after notice of the proposed cancellation or
nonrenewal has been mailed to the association, each unit owner
and each mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust to
whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued
at their respective last known addresses.
"(h) Any portion of the condominium for which
insurance is required under this section which is damaged or
destroyed must be repaired or replaced promptly by the
association unless:
"(1) The condominium is terminated, in which case
Section 35-8A-218 applies,
"(2) Repair or replacement would be illegal under
any state or local statute or ordinance governing health or
safety, or
"(3) Eighty percent of the unit owners, including
every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element which
will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild. The cost of repair
or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds, including any
deductible or retention under any contract of insurance, and
reserves is a common expense.
"If the entire condominium is not repaired or
replaced, (i) the insurance proceeds attributable to the
damaged common elements must be used to restore the damaged
area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the
condominium, (ii) except to the extent that other persons will
be distributees under Section 35-8A-205(a)(12)(ii),
"(1) The insurance proceeds attributable to units
and limited common elements which are not rebuilt must be
distributed to the owners of those units and the owners of the
units to which those limited common elements were allocated,
or to lienholders, as their interests may appear, and
"(2) The remainder of the proceeds must be
distributed to all the unit owners or lienholders, as their
interests may appear, in proportion to the common element
interests of all the units.
"If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit,
that unit's allocated interests are automatically reallocated
upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under Section
35-8A-107(a), and the association promptly shall prepare,
execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting
the reallocations.
"(i) The provisions of this section may be varied or
waived in the case of a condominium all of whose units are
restricted to nonresidential use.
"(j) Unless the declaration provides otherwise, the
association shall pay any cost in excess of insurance
proceeds, including any deductible or retention under any
contract of insurance as a common expense.
"ยง35-8A-314.
"Unless otherwise provided in the declaration or
bylaws, any surplus funds of the association remaining after
payment of or provision for common expenses and any prepayment
of reserves must be paid to the unit owners in proportion to
their common expense liabilities or credited to them to reduce
their future common expense assessments, or held in reserve.
"ยง35-8A-315.
"(a) Until the association makes a common expense
assessment, the declarant must pay all common expenses. After
any assessment has been made by the association, assessments
must be made at least annually, based on a budget adopted at
least annually by the association.
"(b) Except for assessments under subsections (c),
(d), and (e), all common expenses must be assessed against all
the units in accordance with the allocations set forth in the
declaration pursuant to Section 35-8A-207(a) and (b). Any past
due common expense assessment or installment thereof bears
interest at the rate established by the association not
exceeding 18 percent per year.
"(c) To the extent required by the declaration:
"(1) Any common expense associated with the
maintenance, repair, or replacement of a limited common
element must be assessed against the units to which that
limited common element is assigned, equally, or in any other
proportion that the declaration provides;
"(2) Any common expense or portion thereof
benefiting fewer than all of the units must be assessed
exclusively against the units benefited; and
"(3) The costs of insurance must be assessed in
proportion to risk and the costs of utilities must may be
assessed in proportion to usage.
"(d) Assessments to pay a judgment against the
association under Section 35-8A-317(a) may be made only
against the units in the condominium at the time the judgment
was entered, in proportion to their common expense
liabilities.
"(e) If any common expense is caused by the
misconduct of any unit owner or such unit owner's invitee, the
association may assess that expense exclusively against his or
her unit after notice and an opportunity to be heard.
"(f) If common expense liabilities are reallocated,
common expense assessments and any installment thereof not yet
due shall be recalculated in accordance with the reallocated
common expense liabilities.
"(g) All assessments, including utilities, fees, and
other charges shall also constitute the personal obligation of
the unit owner to the association.
"(h) No unit owner other than the association shall
be exempted from any liability for any assessment under this
code section or under any condominium instrument for any
reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, abandonment,
nonuse, or waiver of the use or enjoyment of his or her unit
or any part of the common elements.
"ยง35-8A-316.
"(a) The association has a lien on a unit for any
assessment and any other moneys due the association for
special assessments or services or charges, such as water or
repairs, levied against that unit or fines imposed against its
unit owner from the time the assessment or fine becomes due is
levied. The association's lien may be foreclosed in like
manner as a mortgage on real estate but the and as provided in
the declaration and in Section 35-10-11 or Article 1A of
Chapter 10 of this title and subject to the right under
Article 14A of Chapter 5 of Title 6. The association shall
give send reasonable advance notice of its proposed action to
the unit owner and all lienholders of record of who have
provided a notice address in the record instrument evidencing
the lien on the unit. Unless the declaration otherwise
provides, fees, charges, late charges, fines, and interest
charged pursuant to Section 35-8A-302(a)(10), (11), and (12)
are enforceable as assessments under this section. If an
assessment is payable in installments, the full amount of the
assessment is a lien from the time the first installment
thereof becomes due it is levied.
"(b) A lien under this section is prior to all other
liens and encumbrances on a unit except (i) liens and
encumbrances recorded before the recordation of the
declaration, (ii) a first security interest on the unit
recorded before the date on which the assessment sought to be
enforced became delinquent, and (iii) liens for real estate
taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against
the unit. The lien is also prior to the mortgages and deeds of
trust described in clause (ii) above to the extent of the
common expense assessments based on the periodic budget
adopted by the association pursuant to Section 35-8A-315(a)
which would have become due in the absence of acceleration
during the six months immediately preceding institution of an
action to enforce the lien. This subsection does not affect
the priority of mechanics' or materialmen's liens, or the
priority of liens for other assessments made by the
association. The lien under this section is not subject to the
provisions of homestead or other exemptions.
"(c) Unless the declaration otherwise provides, if
two or more associations have liens for assessments created at
any time on the same real estate, those liens have equal
priority.
"(d) Recording of the declaration constitutes record
notice and perfection of the lien. No further recordation of
any claim of lien for assessment under this section is
required.
"(e) A lien for unpaid assessments is extinguished
unless proceedings to enforce the lien are instituted within
three years after the full amount of the assessments becomes
due.
"(f) This section does not prohibit actions to
recover sums for which subsection (a) creates a lien or
prohibit an association from taking a deed in lieu of
foreclosure.
"(g) A judgment or decree in any action brought
under this or the preceding section must include costs and
reasonable attorney's fees actually incurred for to the
prevailing party.
"(h) Any unit owner, mortgagee of a unit, person
having executed a contract for the purchase of a condominium
unit, or lender considering the loan of funds to be secured by
a condominium unit shall be entitled upon request to a
statement from the association or its management agent setting
forth the amount of assessments levied against the unit,
including information regarding whether such assessments are
past due, and unpaid together with late charges and interest
applicable thereto against that condominium unit. Such request
shall be in writing, shall be delivered to the registered
office of the association, and shall state an address to which
the statement is to be directed. Failure on the part of the
association to mail or otherwise furnish such statement
regarding amounts due and payable if specified in the written
request therefor within 10 business days from the receipt of
such request releases the association's lien against the unit
for the amount of the assessment as of that date, but does not
discharge the unit owner's debt to the association. The
information specified in such statement shall be binding upon
the association and upon every unit owner. Payment of a
reasonable fee not exceeding $10.00 may be required as a
prerequisite to the issuance of such a statement if the
condominium instruments so provide.
"ยง35-8A-317.
"(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), a
judgment for money against the association if recorded is not
a lien on the common elements, but is a lien in favor of the
judgment lienholder against all of the units in the
condominium at the time the judgment was entered. No other
property of a unit owner is subject to the claims of creditors
of the association.
"(b) If the association has granted a security
interest in the common elements to a creditor of the
association pursuant to Section 35-8A-312, the holder of that
security interest shall exercise its right against the common
elements before its judgment lien on any unit may be enforced.
"(c) Whether perfected before or after the creation
of the condominium, if a lien other than a deed of trust or
mortgage, including a judgment lien or lien attributable to
work performed or materials supplied before creation of the
condominium, becomes effective against two or more units, the
unit owner of an affected unit may pay to the lienholder the
amount of the lien attributable to his or her unit, and the
lienholder, upon receipt of payment, promptly shall deliver a
release of the lien covering that unit. The amount of the
payment must be proportionate to the ratio which that unit
owner's common expense liability bears to the common expense
liabilities of all unit owners whose units are subject to the
lien. After payment, the association may not assess or have a
lien against that unit owner's unit for any portion of the
common expenses incurred in connection with that lien.
"(d) A judgment against the association must be
indexed in the name of the condominium and the association
and, when so indexed, is notice of the lien against the units.
"ยง35-8A-318.
"The association shall keep financial records
sufficiently detailed to enable the association to comply with
Section 35-8A-409. All financial and other records shall be
made reasonably available for examination by any unit owner
and his or her authorized agents and such records shall be
made available in the county where the condominium is located.
A reasonable fee or hourly charge may be assessed for this
service.
