SYNOPSIS:             Under existing law, elder abuse and neglect
and financial exploitation of an elderly person are
crimes.
This bill would establish the Elder Abuse
Protection Order and Enforcement Act.
This bill would provide for the issuance of
elder abuse protection orders to provide greater
protection and assistance to victims of elder
abuse.
This bill would define elder abuse and other
terms.
This bill would authorize certain
individuals in addition to the victim to petition
for an elder abuse protection order.
This bill would provide penalties for

Amendment 621 of the Constitution of Alabama
of 1901, now appearing as Section 111.05 of the
Official Recompilation of the Constitution of
Alabama of 1901, as amended, prohibits a general
law whose purpose or effect would be to require a
new or increased expenditure of local funds from
becoming effective with regard to a local
governmental entity without enactment by a 2/3 vote
unless: it comes within one of a number of
specified exceptions; it is approved by the
affected entity; or the Legislature appropriates
funds, or provides a local source of revenue, to
the entity for the purpose.
The purpose or effect of this bill would be
to require a new or increased expenditure of local
funds within the meaning of the amendment. However,
the bill does not require approval of a local
governmental entity or enactment by a 2/3 vote to
become effective because it comes within one of the
specified exceptions contained in the amendment.

Section 11. A law enforcement officer may arrest any
person for a violation of Sections 1 to 11, inclusive, if the
officer has probable cause to believe that the person has
violated any provision of a valid elder abuse protection
order, whether temporary or permanent. The presentation of an
elder abuse protection order constitutes probable cause for an
officer to believe that a valid order exists. For purposes of
Sections 1 to 11, inclusive, the elder abuse protection order
may be inscribed on a tangible copy or may be stored in an
electronic or other medium if it is retrievable in a
detectable form. Presentation of a certified copy of the elder
abuse protection order is not required for enforcement or to
allow a law enforcement officer to effect a warrantless
arrest. If an elder abuse protection order is not presented to
or otherwise confirmed by a law enforcement officer, the
officer may consider other information in determining whether
there is probable cause to believe that a valid protection
order exists. The law enforcement officer may arrest the
defendant without a warrant although he or she did not
personally see the violation. Knowledge by the officer of the
existence or contents of, or both, or presentation to the
officer by the complainant of, an elder abuse protection order
shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the
order. If a law enforcement officer determines that an
otherwise valid elder abuse protection order cannot be
enforced because the defendant has not been notified or served
with the protection order, the law enforcement officer shall
inform the defendant of the order and allow the person a
reasonable opportunity to comply with the order's provisions
before enforcing the order. In the event the law enforcement
officer provides notice of the elder abuse protection order to
the defendant, the officer shall document this fact in the
written report.
Section 12. Section 15-10-3, Code of Alabama 1975,
is amended to read as follows:
"§15-10-3.
"(a) An officer may arrest a person without a
warrant, on any day and at any time in any of the following
instances:
"(1) If a public offense has been committed or a
breach of the peace threatened in the presence of the officer.
"(2) When a felony has been committed, though not in
the presence of the officer, by the person arrested.
"(3) When a felony has been committed and the
officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person
arrested committed the felony.
"(4) When the officer has reasonable cause to
believe that the person arrested has committed a felony,
although it may afterwards appear that a felony had not in
fact been committed.
"(5) When a charge has been made, upon reasonable
cause, that the person arrested has committed a felony.
"(6) When the officer has actual knowledge that a
warrant for the person's arrest for the commission of a felony
or misdemeanor has been issued, provided the warrant was
issued in accordance with this chapter. However, upon request
the officer shall show the warrant to the arrested person as
soon as possible. If the officer does not have the warrant in
his or her possession at the time of arrest the officer shall
inform the defendant of the offense charged and of the fact
that a warrant has been issued.
"(7) When the officer has reasonable cause to
believe that a felony or misdemeanor has been committed by the
person arrested in violation of a protection order, including
a domestic violence protection order or an elder abuse
protection order, issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.
"(8) When an offense involves domestic violence as
defined in Section 13A-6-139.1 or elder abuse as defined in
Section 3 of the act adding this amendatory language, and the
arrest is based on probable cause, regardless of whether the
offense is a felony or misdemeanor.
"(b) When a law enforcement officer investigates an
allegation of domestic violence or elder abuse, whether or not
an arrest is made, the officer shall make a written report of
the alleged incident, including a statement of the complaint,
and the disposition of the case.
"(c) If the defendant is arrested under this section
for committing an act of domestic violence in violation of a
domestic violence protection order or an act of elder abuse in
violation of an elder abuse protection order, the defendant
shall be held in custody until brought before the court as
expeditiously as possible for the purpose of enforcing the
protection order and for consideration of bail in accordance
with Section 15-13-190 and the applicable rules of criminal
procedure, pending a hearing."
Section 13. Although this bill would have as its
purpose or effect the requirement of a new or increased
expenditure of local funds, the bill is excluded from further
requirements and application under Amendment 621, now
appearing as Section 111.05 of the Official Recompilation of
the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, as amended, because the
bill defines a new crime or amends the definition of an
existing crime.
Section 14. This act shall become effective on the
first day of the third month following its passage and
approval by the Governor, or its otherwise becoming law.
