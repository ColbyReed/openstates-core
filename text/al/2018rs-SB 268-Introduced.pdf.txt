Alabama.
This bill would further provide for the
length of certain vehicles and would allow motor
vehicle weight increases for vehicles that have
conversion equipment installed allowing the vehicle
to operate on compressed natural gas or compressed
liquefied gas.
A BILL
TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT
To amend Section 32-9-20, Code of Alabama 1975, as
last amended by Act 2017-442, 2017 Regular Session, relating
to the restrictions on the operation of certain motor
vehicles; to further provide for the length of certain
vehicles; and to allow for weight increases for vehicles
having conversion equipment installed that allows the vehicle
to operate on compressed natural gas or compressed liquefied
gas.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA:
Section 1. Section 32-9-20, Code of Alabama 1975, as
last amended by Act 2017-442, 2017 Regular Session, is amended
to read as follows:
"ยง32-9-20.
"(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to drive or
move on any highway in this state any vehicle or vehicles of a
size or weight except in accordance with the following:
"(1) WIDTH. Vehicles and combinations of vehicles,
operating on highways with traffic lanes 12 feet or more in
width, shall not exceed a total outside width, including any
load thereon, of 102 inches, exclusive of mirrors or other
safety devices approved by the State Transportation
Department. The Director of the State Transportation
Department may, in his or her discretion, designate other
public highways for use by vehicles and loads with total
outside widths not exceeding 102 inches, otherwise; vehicles
and combinations of vehicles, operating on highways with
traffic lanes less than 12 feet in width, shall not exceed a
total outside width, including any load thereon, of 96 inches,
exclusive of mirrors or other safety devices approved by the
State Transportation Department. No passenger vehicle shall
carry any load extending beyond the line of the fenders. No
vehicle hauling forest products or culvert pipe on any highway
in this state shall have a load exceeding 102 inches in width.
"(2) HEIGHT. No vehicle or semitrailer or trailer
shall exceed in height 13 1/2 feet, including load.
"(3) LENGTH. No vehicle shall exceed in length 40
feet; except, that the length of a truck-semitrailer
combination, semitrailers, including load, used in a truck
tractor-semitrailer combination, shall not exceed 57 feet;
semitrailers and trailers, including load, used in a truck
tractor-semitrailer-trailer combination, shall not exceed 28
1/2 feet each; and motor vehicles designed, used, or
maintained primarily as a mobile dwelling, office, or
commercial space, commonly called motor homes, shall not
exceed 45 feet. Semitrailers exceeding 53 1/2 feet shall only
be operated on highways designated pursuant to Section 32-9-1
and shall only be operated when the distance between the
kingpin of the semitrailer and the rearmost axle or a point
midway between the two rear axles, if the two rear axles are
tandem axles, does not exceed 41 feet and if the semitrailer
is equipped with a rear underride guard of a substantial
construction consisting of a continuous lateral beam extending
to within four inches of the lateral extremities of the
semitrailer and located not more than 22 inches from the
surface as measured with the semitrailers empty and on a level
surface. For purposes of enforcement of this subdivision,
lengths of semitrailers and trailers refer to the cargo
carrying portion of the unit. Truck tractor units used
exclusively in combinations transporting motor vehicles may
directly carry a portion of the cargo, provided that the
combinations are restricted to truck tractor-semitrailer
combinations only and provided further that the overall length
of these particular combinations shall not exceed 65 feet;
except that the overall length of stinger-steered type units
shall not exceed 75 80 feet. No truck tractor-semitrailer
combination used exclusively for transporting motor vehicles
shall carry any load extending more than three four feet
beyond the front or four six feet beyond the rear of the
combination. No other vehicle operated on a highway shall
carry any load extending more than a total of five feet beyond
both the front and rear, inclusive, of the vehicle.
"(4) WEIGHT.
"a. The gross weight imposed on the highway by the
wheels of any one axle of a vehicle shall not exceed 20,000
pounds, or such other weight, if any, as may be permitted by
federal law to keep the state from losing federal funds;
provided, that inadequate bridges shall be posted to define
load limits.
"b. For the purpose of this section, an axle load
shall be defined as the total load transmitted to the road by
all wheels whose centers are included between two parallel
transverse vertical planes 40 inches apart, extending across
the full width of the vehicle.
"c. Subject to the limit upon the weight imposed
upon the highway through any one axle as set forth herein, the
total weight with load imposed upon the highway by all the
axles of a vehicle or combination of vehicles shall not exceed
the gross weight given for the respective distances between
the first and last axle of the vehicle or combination of vehi-
cles, measured longitudinally to the nearest foot as set forth
in the following table:

"Except as provided by special permits, no vehicle
or combination of vehicles exceeding the gross weights
specified above shall be permitted to travel on the public
highways within the State of Alabama.
"No vehicle or combination of vehicles shall be per-
mitted to operate on any portion of the Interstate Highway
System of Alabama that shall have a greater weight than 20,000
pounds carried on any one axle, including all enforcement tol-
erances, or with a tandem axle weight in excess of 34,000
pounds, including all enforcement tolerances, or with an over-
all gross weight on a group of two or more consecutive axles
produced by application of the following formula:
W=500    LN     +      12N   +   36
N-1
where W = overall gross weight on any group of two
or more consecutive axles to the nearest 500 pounds, L =
distance in feet between the extreme of any group of two or
more consecutive axles, and N = number of axles in group under
consideration; except, that two consecutive sets of tandem
axles may carry a gross load of 34,000 pounds each, provided
the overall distance between the first and last axles of the
consecutive sets of tandem axles is 36 feet or more; provided,
that the overall gross weight may not exceed 80,000 pounds,
including all enforcement tolerances. Nothing in this section
shall be construed as permitting size or weight limits on the
National System of Interstate and Defense Highways in this
state in excess of those permitted under 23 U.S.C. Section
127. If the federal government prescribes or adopts vehicle
size or weight limits greater than or less than those now
prescribed by 23 U.S.C. Section 127 for the National System of
Interstate and Defense Highways, the increased or decreased
limits shall become effective on the National System of
Interstate and Defense Highways in this state. Nothing in this
section shall be construed to deny the operation of any
vehicle or combination of vehicles that could be lawfully
operated upon the highways and roads of this state on January
4, 1975.
"d. For purposes of enforcement of this subdivision,
all weights less than or equal to the sum of the weight
otherwise prescribed by this subdivision, plus an additional
weight to be calculated by multiplying the weight prescribed
by this subdivision by one-tenth (.10) that shall represent a
scale or enforcement tolerance, shall be deemed to be in
compliance with the requirements of this section, and shall
not constitute violations thereof. No evidence shall be
admitted into evidence or considered by the trier of fact in
any civil action unless the evidence proffered would tend to
prove that the weight of the vehicle exceeded the amount
provided in this subsection. Nothing in this paragraph d.
shall restrict or affect the right of any defendant to place
in evidence such evidence tending to prove the defendant was
in compliance with this section.
"e. Dump trucks, dump trailers, concrete mixing
trucks, fuel oil, gasoline trucks, and trucks designated and
constructed for special type work or use shall not be made to
conform to the axle spacing requirements of paragraph (4)c of
this section; provided, that the vehicle shall be limited to a
weight of 20,000 pounds per axle plus scale tolerances; and,
provided further, that the maximum gross weight of the
vehicles shall not exceed the maximum weight allowed by this
section for the appropriate number of axles, irrespective of
the distance between axles, plus allowable scale tolerances.
All axles shall be brake equipped. Trucks delivering asphalt
plant mix which do not exceed the maximum allowable gross
weight and operate within 50 miles of their home base shall
not be required to conform to the requirements of paragraph
(4)a of this section. Concrete mixing trucks which operate
within 50 miles of their home base and do not exceed the
maximum allowable gross weight shall not be required to
conform to the requirements of paragraph (4)a of this section.
It shall be a violation if the vehicles named under this
subdivision travel upon bridges designated and posted by the
Transportation Director as incapable of carrying the load.
"f. If the driver of any vehicle can comply with the
weight requirements of this section by shifting or equalizing
the load on all wheels or axles and does so when requested by
the proper authority, the driver shall not be held to be
operating in violation of this section.
"g. When portable scales are used in the enforcement
of this section, the axles of any vehicle described or
commonly referred to as tandem or triaxle rigs or units (that
is, vehicles having two or more axles in addition to a
steering axle), the group of tandem or triaxles shall be
weighed simultaneously, and the total weight so derived shall
be divided by the number of axles weighed in the group to
arrive at the per axle weight, except that if any one axle in
the group exceeds 20,000 pounds in weight, it shall not exceed
the weight of any other axle in the group by more than 50
percent. When portable scales are used to determine the weight
of a vehicle pursuant to this section, the operator of the
vehicle will be permitted to move the vehicle to the nearest
platform scales certified by the Department of Agriculture and
Industries and operated by a bonded operator within a distance
of 10 highway miles, accompanied by an enforcement officer to
verify the accuracy of the portable scales used in determining
the vehicle weight. If the weight of the vehicle is shown by
the platform scales to be within the legal limits of this
section, the operator of the vehicle shall not be held to be
in violation of this section.
"h. The governing body of a county, by appropriate
resolution, may authorize limitations less than those
prescribed herein for vehicles operated upon the county
highways of the county.
"i. The State Transportation Department may post or
limit any road or bridge to weights less than those prescribed
by this section. It is the legislative intent and purpose that
this section be rigidly enforced by the State Transportation
Department, the Alabama State Law Enforcement Agency and any
other authorized law enforcement officers of the state, any
county, or city and incorporated towns.
"j. Two and three axle vehicles being used
exclusively for the purpose of transporting agricultural
commodities or products to and from a farm and for
agricultural purposes relating to the operation and
maintenance of a farm by any farmer, custom harvester or
husbandman may not be made to conform to the axle requirements
of paragraph (4)a of this section or the gross weight
requirements of paragraph (4)c of this section.
"(b)(1) Any vehicle utilizing an auxiliary power or
idle reduction technology unit in order to promote reduction
of fuel use and emissions because of engine idling shall be
allowed an additional 400 pounds total to the gross, axle,
tandem, or bridge formula weight limits defined in this
section.
"(2) To be eligible for the exception provided in
this subsection, the operator of the vehicle must provide
written proof or certification of the weight of the auxiliary
power unit (APU) and demonstrate or certify the idle reduction
technology is fully functional at all times.
"(3) Written proof or certification of the weight of
the APU must be available to law enforcement officers if the
vehicle is found in violation of applicable weight laws. The
weight allowed cannot exceed 400 pounds or the actual weight
proven or certified, whichever is less.
"(4) It is the intent of this subsection to apply at
the state highway level the weight limit increase for vehicles
using a functioning auxiliary power or idle reduction
technology as provided in the Federal Energy Policy Act of
2005.
"(c)(1) Any motor vehicle, if operated by an engine
fueled primarily by natural gas, may exceed any vehicle weight
limit, up to a maximum gross vehicle weight of 82,000 pounds,
under this section by an amount that is equal to the
difference between:
"a. The weight of the vehicle attributable to the
natural gas tank and fueling system carried by that vehicle;
and
"b. The weight of a comparable diesel tank and
fueling system.
"(2) This subsection applies on federal interstate
highways to the weight limit increases for vehicles using an
EPA certified natural gas engine or an EPA approved conversion
unit installed on the vehicle which allows the vehicle to
operate primarily on compressed natural gas or liquefied
natural gas."
Section 2. This act shall become effective on the
first day of the third month following its passage and
approval by the Governor, or its otherwise becoming law.
