"ยง15-20A-27.
"(a) In determining whether to apply notification
requirements to a juvenile sex offender, the sentencing court
shall consider any of the following factors relevant to the

guidance and supervision.
"(2) Physical conditions that minimize the risk of
re-offense, including, but not limited to, advanced age or
debilitating illness.
"(3) Criminal history factors indicative of high
risk of re-offense, including whether the conduct of the
juvenile sex offender was found to be characterized by
repetitive and compulsive behavior.
"(4) Whether psychological or psychiatric profiles
indicate a risk of recidivism.
"(5) The relationship between the juvenile sex
offender and the victim.
"(6) The particular facts and circumstances
surrounding the offense.

stating whether the juvenile sex offender shall be subject to
notification and the level of notification that shall be
applied. The court shall provide a copy of the order to the

not committed, the juvenile sex offender and the parent,
custodian, or guardian shall register all required
registration information with local law enforcement in each
county in which the juvenile sex offender resides or intends
to reside.

"(f) A juvenile sex offender required to register
for 10 years pursuant to Section 15-20A-28 shall appear in
person with his or her parent, custodian, or guardian to

with local law enforcement in each county of residence unless
the juvenile sex offender has been relieved from registration
requirements pursuant to Section 15-20A-24.
"(g) At the time of registration, the juvenile sex
offender shall be provided a form explaining all duties and
any restrictions placed on the juvenile sex offender. The
juvenile sex offender and the parent, custodian, or guardian
of the juvenile sex offender shall read and sign this form
stating that he or she understands the duties and restrictions

State Board of Education shall develop a comprehensive model
policy for the supervision and monitoring of juvenile sex
offender students, who have a low risk of re-offense and are
enrolled, attending class, and participating in school
activities with the general population of students. The
purpose of the model policy is to provide a safe and secure
environment for all students and staff. The model policy shall
be adopted by each local board of education and implemented
beginning with the 2020-2021 school year. The model policy, at
a minimum, shall contain all of the following components:
a. Application to all school property and
school-sponsored functions including, but not limited to,
classroom instructional time, assemblies, athletic events,
extracurricular activities, and school bus transportation.
b. An initial meeting of all parties immediately
upon the enrollment of the low risk juvenile sex offender, and
frequent meetings thereafter as necessary to provide for the
continual monitoring of the student and a safe school
environment for all. The principal and all appropriate school
personnel who have received confidential notification pursuant
to subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of Section 15-20A-27,
Code of Alabama 1975, in consultation with juvenile probation
professionals, shall meet with the student, and the parent or
guardian of the student, to create and implement an
individualized student safety plan. The principal shall
determine other appropriate school personnel to be included in
the meetings to assist in defining school expectations.
Student safety plans shall outline the responsibilities of all
parties in safely managing the behavior of the student and
protecting all students. The plan shall be consistent with
existing disciplinary policies and procedures, student conduct
policies, and mandatory reporting policies. Student safety
plans shall include, but not be limited to, all of the
following:
1. An outline of conditions or limitations, or both,
on the low risk juvenile sex offender concerning his or her
interactions on school property and when participating in
school activities.
2. An effective procedure, developed in conjunction
with school staff in consultation with the parent or guardian
of the student, for communicating concerns relating to the
student.
3. Guidelines for expected intervention actions for
high-risk behaviors and for reinforcing positive behaviors
based on the needs of the student and the safety of all
students and staff.
4. Procedures for the continual review of each plan
by staff designated by the principal and for monitoring and
changing the plan on an as-needed basis by school staff.
5. Safeguards for protecting confidential
information.
c. Continuity of information and monitoring of
low-risk juvenile sex offender students over time as the
students change schools and as administrators and school
personnel change.
d. Comprehensive training for school personnel to
take appropriate action upon noticing an increase or
escalation of those behaviors in a low risk juvenile sex
offender student, both for the short and long-term safety of
that student and all other students.

requirements pursuant to Section 26-14-3, Code of Alabama
1975, school personnel shall report violations of plan
expectations to the principal when they occur. Upon
notification, the principal, as appropriate, shall follow the
procedures and intervention actions detailed in the safety
plan created pursuant to this section.
(2) When a low risk juvenile sex offender student
changes schools, the principal shall notify local law
enforcement and local law enforcement shall notify the
principal of the new school and, where applicable, the local
superintendent of education pursuant to subsection (b) of
Section 15-20A-27, Code of Alabama 1975. The principal of the
prior school shall ensure that all records and safety plans
pertaining to the low risk juvenile sex offender student
follow the student to his or her new school. If the sex
offender status or probation or parole status of the student
changes, the principal shall notify the appropriate school
staff as part of the safety planning of the school. The
principal and school staff shall maintain confidentiality
regarding these students as required by law. Any information
received by a principal, school personnel, or local
superintendent of education as a result of a notification is
confidential and may not be further disseminated except as
provided in Section 15-20A-27, Code of Alabama 1975, and other
state law and the Family and Educational and Privacy Rights
Act of 1994, 20 U.S. Code Section 1232g et. seq. Any school
district employee who releases information in compliance with
state and federal law is immune from civil liability in
accordance with Section 36-1-12, Code of Alabama 1975.
(b)(1) The sentencing court shall have the
discretion to determine whether a juvenile sex offender
classified as having a moderate or high risk or reoffending
should return to a public school. Upon making this
determination, the court shall consult with a juvenile
probation officer and the local superintendent of education to
determine appropriate educational placement.
(2) Any alternative placement of a student with a
disability who receives special education services shall be
made in compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act, 20 U.S.C. ยง1400 et seq., and its implementing
regulations, 34 C.F.R. Part 300.
