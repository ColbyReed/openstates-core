COMMENDING LIEUTENANT GREG MCGHEE ON RECEIVING THE
SCOTTSBORO POLICE DEPARTMENT LIFE SAVING CERTIFICATE.
WHEREAS, it is with highest commendation that we
recognize Lieutenant Greg McGhee on receiving the Scottsboro
Police Department Life Saving Certificate; and
WHEREAS, while effecting a felony robbery arrest at
the intersection of Highway 72 and Snodgrass Road on August
10, 2017, Lieutenant Greg McGhee witnessed a vehicle that was
traveling west on Highway 72 leave the roadway, crash into an
embankment, and partially overturn; he and Officer Kris Roney
drove their patrol cars a short distance, exited their
vehicles, and ran toward the flame engulfed vehicle; while
Lieutenant McGhee warded off the fire with a fire extinguisher
and searched for occupants inside the vehicle, Officer Roney
climbed into the overturned vehicle's broken sunroof and
located the driver, Jennifer Nicole Brownfield, 39, of
Scottsboro, Alabama; Officer Roney ensured there was no one
else inside the vehicle before coaxing Ms. Brownfield to
stand, grabbing her from under her arms, and pulling her out
of the burning vehicle; Officer Roney carried Ms. Brownfield
to a safe distance so she would not incur harm in case the
vehicle should explode; Lieutenant McGhee continued to douse
the fire and ensure that no other occupants were inside the
smoke filled vehicle; and
WHEREAS, placed in a life-threatening situation and
without a moment's hesitation, Lieutenant Greg McGhee placed
himself in the line of peril and saved a life; for his
meritorious actions, Lieutenant McGhee received the Scottsboro
Police Department Life Saving Certificate; and
WHEREAS, Lieutenant Greg McGhee demonstrated immense
courage, diligence, and quick response in a life-threatening
situation; his loyalty and unwavering commitment to protect
and serve the residents of Scottsboro were evidenced through
his willingness to make the quick and proper response in order
to protect the lives of others; and
WHEREAS, Lieutenant Greg McGhee epitomizes the
qualities of those who serve and protect, and he is truly
deserving of the distinguished honor bestowed upon him; now
therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA, That we hereby recognize and honor
Lieutenant Greg McGhee as a recipient of the Scottsboro Police
Department Life Saving Certificate and direct that he receive
a copy of this resolution as evidence of our admiration and
esteem.
