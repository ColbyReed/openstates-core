RECOGNIZING THE BOUNTSVILLE HISTORICAL PARK AS A
STATE HISTORICAL SITE.
WHEREAS, the Blountsville Historical Park originated
as an ancient trail used by Native Americans; and
WHEREAS, the well-traveled trail became the main
thoroughfare for the Town of Blountsville and was known in
1813 as Bear Meat Cabin Road; and
WHEREAS, by 1818, the thoroughfare gained
recognition as a prominent trade route for the Alabama
Territory and was known as the St. Stephens-Huntsville Road;
and
WHEREAS, the St. Stephens-Huntsville Road was
designated as the post road in 1822 and was part of the mail
route between New Orleans an Cincinnati, where Alabama's first
stage line traveled; and
WHEREAS, between 1816 and 1818, thousands of
settlers from the Carolinas and Tennessee traveled along the
St. Stephens-Huntsville Road into Alabama; the term "Alabama
Fever" was coined to describe the emotions that led to the
great migration to Alabama during this era; and
WHEREAS, the newcomers desired to obtain land grants
and claim property in an effort to start a new life; in 1813,
800 volunteers from Tennessee, including David Crockett,
traveled the St. Stephens-Huntsville Road to join General
Andrew Jackson at Gunter's Landing; now therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA, BOTH
HOUSES THEREOF CONCURRING, That we hereby recognize the
Bountsville Historical Park as a state historical site and
request that it be placed on the State Registry of Historic
Places.
