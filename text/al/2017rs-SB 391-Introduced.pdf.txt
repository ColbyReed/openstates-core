SYNOPSIS:          This bill would relate to persons charged
with driving under the influence and the
installation of ignition interlock devices on
vehicles.
This bill would: Require each person
approved for a pretrial diversion program to be
required to have an ignition interlock device
installed for a certain period of time; provide
that a portion of the court fee would be
distributed to the municipal court if the case is a
municipal court case when the person is ordered or
agrees to have an ignition interlock device; delete
the requirement for indigents to pay for the
services; provide that a person convicted of a
third offense would be authorized or required to
obtain an ignition interlock device after the
completion of his or her incarceration; would
require manufacturers to provide ignition interlock
services to indigent under certain conditions
without charge; and would specify the number of
violations for extension of ignition interlock
requirements to be consistent with Department of
Forensic Sciences rules.
Amendment 621 of the Constitution of Alabama
of 1901, now appearing as Section 111.05 of the
Official Recompilation of the Constitution of
Alabama of 1901, as amended, prohibits a general
law whose purpose or effect would be to require a
new or increased expenditure of local funds from
becoming effective with regard to a local
governmental entity without enactment by a 2/3 vote
unless: it comes within one of a number of
specified exceptions; it is approved by the
affected entity; or the Legislature appropriates
funds, or provides a local source of revenue, to
the entity for the purpose.
The purpose or effect of this bill would be
to require a new or increased expenditure of local
funds within the meaning of the amendment. However,
the bill does not require approval of a local
governmental entity or enactment by a 2/3 vote to
become effective because it comes within one of the
specified exceptions contained in the amendment.

of Alabama 1975, to further require for the use of ignition
interlock devices including by persons approved for pretrial

"The Alabama habitual felony offender law shall not
apply to a conviction of a felony pursuant to this subsection,
and a conviction of a felony pursuant to this subsection shall
not be a felony conviction for purposes of the enhancement of
punishment pursuant to Alabama's habitual felony offender law.
However, prior misdemeanor or felony convictions for driving
under the influence may be considered as part of the
sentencing calculations or determinations under the Alabama
Sentencing Guidelines or rules promulgated by the Alabama
Sentencing Commission.
"(i) When any person convicted of violating this
section is found to have had at least 0.15 percent or more by
weight of alcohol in his or her blood while operating or being
in actual physical control of a vehicle, he or she shall be
sentenced to at least double the minimum punishment that the
person would have received if he or she had had less than 0.15
percent by weight of alcohol in his or her blood. Upon the
first violation of this subsection, the offender shall be
ordered by the court to have an ignition interlock device
installed and operating on his or her designated motor vehicle
for a period of two years from the date of issuance of an
ignition interlock-restricted driver's license. If the
adjudicated offense is a misdemeanor, the minimum punishment
shall be imprisonment for one year, all of which may be
suspended except as otherwise provided for in subsections (f)
and (g).
"(j) When any person over the age of 21 years is
convicted of violating this section and it is found that a
child under the age of 14 years was a passenger in the vehicle
at the time of the offense, the person shall be sentenced to
at least double the minimum punishment that the person would
have received if the child had not been a passenger in the
motor vehicle.
"(k)(1) In addition to the penalties provided
herein, any person convicted of violating this section shall
be referred to the court referral officer for evaluation and
referral to appropriate community resources. The defendant
shall, at a minimum, be required to complete a DUI or
substance abuse court referral program approved by the
Administrative Office of Courts and operated in accordance
with provisions of the Mandatory Treatment Act of 1990,
Sections 12-23-1 to 12-23-19, inclusive. The Alabama State Law
Enforcement Agency shall not reissue a driver's license to a
person convicted under this section without receiving proof
that the defendant has successfully completed the required
program.
"(2) Upon conviction, the court shall notify the
Alabama State Law Enforcement Agency if the person convicted
is required to install and maintain an approved ignition
interlock device. The agency shall suspend or revoke a
person's driving privileges until completion of the mandatory
suspension or revocation period required by this section, and
clearance of all other suspensions, revocations,
cancellations, or denials, and proof of installation of an
approved ignition interlock device is presented to the agency.
The agency shall not reissue a driver's license to a person
who has been ordered by a court or is required by law to have
the ignition interlock device installed until proof is
presented that the person is eligible for reinstatement of
driving privileges. Upon presentation of proof and compliance
with all ignition interlock requirements, the agency shall
issue a driver's license with a restriction indicating that
the licensee may operate a motor vehicle only with the
certified ignition interlock device installed and properly
operating. If the licensee fails to maintain the approved
ignition interlock device as required or is otherwise not in
compliance with any order of the court, the court shall notify
the agency of the noncompliance and the agency shall suspend
the person's driving privileges until the agency receives
notification from the court that the licensee is in
compliance. The requirement that the licensee use the ignition
interlock device may be removed only when the court of
conviction confirms to the agency that the licensee is no
longer subject to the ignition interlock device requirement.
"(l) Neither reckless driving nor any other traffic
infraction is a lesser included offense under a charge of
driving under the influence of alcohol or of a controlled
substance.

"ignition interlock device" means a constant monitoring device
that prevents a motor vehicle from being started at any time
without first determining the equivalent blood alcohol level
of the operator through the taking of a breath sample for
testing. The system shall be calibrated so that the motor
vehicle may not be started if the blood alcohol level of the
operator, as measured by the test, reaches a blood alcohol
concentration level of 0.02.
"(b) The ignition interlock device shall be
installed, calibrated, and monitored directly by trained
technicians who shall train the offender for whom the device
is being installed in the proper use of the device. The use of
a mail in or remote calibration system where the technician is
not in the immediate proximity of the vehicle being calibrated
is prohibited. The Department of Forensic Sciences shall
promulgate rules for punishment and appeal for ignition
interlock providers relating to violation of this subsection.
"(c) The Department of Forensic Sciences shall
formulate and promulgate rules for the proper approval,
installation, and use of ignition interlock devices.
Additionally, the Department of Forensic Sciences shall
maintain and make public the list of approved ignition
interlock devices.
"(d) The Department of Forensic Sciences may adopt
in whole or relevant part the guidelines, rules, regulations,
studies, or independent laboratory tests performed or relied
upon by other states, their agencies, or commissions.
"(e) The Department of Forensic Sciences shall
promulgate rules regulating approved ignition interlock
providers related to areas of consumer coverage. The rules
shall address areas of consumer coverage and shall provide for
a two-year period from July 1, 2014, to allow provider
compliance.
"(f) The Department of Forensic Sciences shall
charge an application fee of two thousand dollars ($2,000) to
any ignition interlock provider to evaluate the instrument.
Any ignition interlock provider whose ignition interlock
device is approved by the Department of Forensic Sciences
shall be permitted to install and calibrate its approved
device in Alabama. Each year during the month of April, the
Department of Forensic Sciences may receive applications and
instruments to review for approval.
"(g) The Department of Public Safety shall be
responsible for enforcing the rules promulgated by the
Department of Forensic Sciences related to ignition interlock
devices and providers. The Department of Public Safety shall
promulgate rules regulating the inspection and enforcement of
approved ignition interlock providers and any associate
service locations.
"(h) In the absence of negligence, wantonness, or
willful misconduct, no person or employer or agent of a person
who installs an ignition interlock device pursuant to Section
32-5A-191 shall be liable for any occurrence related to the
device, including, but not limited to, occurrences resulting
from or related to a malfunction of the device or use of,
misuse of, or failure to use the device or the vehicle in
which the device was installed.
"(i)(1) When the court imposes the use of an
ignition interlock device as required by Section 32-5A-191,
the court shall require that the person provide proof of
installation of a device to the court or a probation officer
within 30 days of the date the defendant becomes eligible to
receive an ignition interlock-restricted license from the
Department of Public Safety. If the person fails to provide
proof of installation within that period, absent a finding by
the court of good cause for that failure which is entered into
the court record, the court may revoke the person's probation
where applicable after a petition to revoke probation has been
filed and the defendant has been given notice and an
opportunity to be heard on the petition. The court in which
the defendant is convicted shall notify the department that
the defendant is restricted to the operation of a motor
vehicle only when an approved ignition interlock device is
installed and properly operating. Nothing in this subsection
shall permit a person who does not own a vehicle or otherwise
have an ignition interlock device installed on a motor vehicle
to operate a motor vehicle without an approved ignition
interlock device installed and properly operating.
"(2) Proof of installation for the purpose of this
subsection may be furnished by either a certificate of
installation or a copy of the lease agreement in the name of
the offender for the designated vehicle with an approved
ignition interlock device company.
"(3) A defendant who is determined by the court to
be indigent for the purpose of ignition interlock may have an
ignition interlock device installed by an ignition interlock
provider as provided in this subsection. Criteria for
determining indigency for the purpose of ignition interlock
shall be the same criteria as set forth in Section 15-12-5(b)
and (c) after the report is complete. In determining whether
the defendant is indigent for the purpose of ignition
interlock, the judge shall require an investigation and report
by a sheriff, adult probation officer, or other officer of the
court. The report may include input from the district attorney
or municipal prosecutor. The defendant shall execute an
affidavit of substantial hardship on a form approved by the
Supreme Court. The completed affidavit of substantial hardship
and the subsequent order of the court either denying or
granting indigency status for the purpose of ignition
interlock to the offender shall become a part of the official
court record in the case and shall be submitted by the
offender to the interlock provider.
"(4) Any offender granted indigency status for the
purpose of ignition interlock shall pay one-half of not be
required to pay the costs associated with installing and
maintaining an interlock device for a the period of no more
than two years at which time the offender shall pay the full
remaining cost for any sentence left for ignition interlock.
The defendant shall pay any fees for any violation of ignition
interlock requirements and for any optional services elected
by the defendant and for any missing or damaged equipment.
This section shall not affect any fees associated with the
driver's license of the defendant.
"(5)a. All interlock providers shall be required to
pay one and one-half percent of all payments collected less
any payments made by a defendant determined as indigent for
the purpose of ignition interlock to the Alabama Ignition
Interlock Indigent Fund in the State Treasury. ALEA shall
require each approved manufacturer to provide a minimum number
of indigent defendants with ignition interlock services,
including installation, lease, calibration, and removal at no
cost to the indigent defendant. The minimum number of indigent
defendants provided services shall be equal to five percent of
the total installations provided by the manufacturer during
the prior calendar year.
"b. ALEA shall oversee the administration of
indigent services on an annual basis by doing all of the
following:
"1. Verifying the total number of installations
provided by the manufacturer each year.

Interlock Indigent Fund.
"b.d. The Alabama Ignition Interlock Indigent Fund
is created in the State Treasury. The fund shall be
administered by the Department of Public Safety ALEA. All
Except as provided in paragraph e., all of the money in the
fund shall be used to reimburse ignition interlock device
providers who have installed devices in vehicles of indigent
persons pursuant to court orders issued under this section. No
provider shall be reimbursed for an interlock device installed
without the completed affidavit of substantial hardship and
the subsequent order of the court granting indigency status.
Payments to interlock device providers pursuant to this
subdivision shall be made every three months. If the amount of

considered payment in full for the requests submitted. At the
end of each fiscal year, all monies above five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000) remaining in the Alabama Ignition
Interlock Indigent Fund shall be divided as follows:
"1. Thirty percent to the Highway Traffic Safety
Fund administered by the Department of Public Safety.
"2. Twenty percent to the Alabama Chemical Testing
Training and Equipment Trust Fund administered by the
Department of Forensic Sciences.
"3. Thirty percent to the District Attorney's
Solicitorโs Fund.
"4. Twenty percent to the Office of Prosecution
Services.
"e. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph d.,
10 percent of the first five hundred thousand dollars
($500,000) collected in the fund each year may be used by ALEA
for any of the following additional purposes on an annual
basis:
"1. Annual reporting and assessment of manufacturer
compliance with indigent service requirements.
"2. Notice and collection of any fines for
noncompliance.
"3. Annual inspection of interlock service centers
by ALEA.
"(6) Any defendant who does not own a vehicle or
otherwise have an ignition interlock device installed on a
vehicle shall be required to pay seventy-five dollars ($75)
per month for the entire period the defendant is required or
elects to have an ignition interlock device. The defendant
shall still serve all license suspension or revocation, or
both, during this period. Any monies paid pursuant to this
subdivision shall be paid to the court clerk and shall be
deposited in the Alabama Impaired Driving Prevention and
Enforcement Fund in the State Treasury to be used by the
Department of Public Safety for impaired driving education and

or another family member of the owner is present in the
vehicle and presents a valid driver's license, shall be
impounded by any duly sworn law enforcement officer pursuant
to Section 32-6-19(c). If there is an emergency or medical
necessity jeopardizing life or limb, the law enforcement
officer may elect not to impound the vehicle.
"(2) A violation of subsection (j) on the first
