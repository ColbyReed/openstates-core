ENROLLED, House Joint Resolution,
RECOGNIZING FEBRUARY 28, 2018, AS RARE DISEASE DAY
IN ALABAMA.
WHEREAS, there are approximately 7,000 diseases and
conditions considered rare, each affecting fewer than 200,000
Americans in the United States according to the National
Institutes of Health (NIH); and
WHEREAS, while each of these diseases may affect
small numbers of people, rare disease as a group affects
almost 30 million people in the United States; and
WHEREAS, eighty percent of rare diseases are genetic
in origin, and it is estimated that about 50 percent of all
rare diseases affect children; and
WHEREAS, while fewer than 500 orphan drugs and
biologic medical products have been approved for the treatment
of rare diseases by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 95
percent of the millions of Americans with rare diseases still
have no approved treatment specific to their disease; and
WHEREAS, rare diseases can become chronic,
progressive, disabling, and life-threatening conditions,
significantly impacting the lives of those affected; and
WHEREAS, relatively common symptoms can hide
underlying rare diseases, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed
treatment; individuals and families affected by rare diseases
often face challenges, such as diagnosis delay, difficulty
finding a medical expert, a sense of isolation and
psychological burden, few treatment options, lack of support
services, and problems related to accessing treatment or
ancillary services; and
WHEREAS, many patients and families affected by less
widely known rare diseases, bear a large share of the burden
regarding critical issues, such as finding adequate treatment
and raising funds for research, education, and awareness to
support the search for those treatments; and
WHEREAS, almost 500,000 residents of Alabama are
among those affected by rare diseases since nearly 1 in 10
Americans in the United States have a rare disease; and
WHEREAS, it is important for Alabamians and all
Americans to support those affected by rare diseases and to
promote the awareness of the needs of rare disease patients
and the acceptance of their diagnoses; and
WHEREAS, rare diseases affect almost 30 million
individuals in the United States and almost 500,000 just in
Alabama. Each disease can severely impact a patient not only
with physical disabilities, but also in many cases with
intellectual disabilities, and for some premature death. In
addition, the disease affects the patient and family as a
whole mentally, emotionally, and financially. Many rare
diseases are genetic or present as birth defects providing for
a lifelong diagnosis. Examples of rare diseases present among
Alabamians, include Multiple Sclerosis, Cerebral Palsy, ALS
(Lou Gehrig's Disease), Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Juvenile
Rheumatoid Arthritis, and pediatric cancers. Individually, a
rare disease is rare; with it only affecting less than 200,000
individuals. However, when rare diseases are looked at
collectively as a community, rare is no longer rare; and
millions are affected, which gives rise to the need for a
comprehensive public health approach, to build awareness, to
educate, and to improve the care and health of those affected
by a rare disease; and
WHEREAS, on the last day of the month of February,
patients, caregivers, and their families, medical
professionals, researchers, government officials, companies
developing treatments for rare diseases, and others in the
State of Alabama join together to focus attention on rare
diseases as a public health issue and participate in the
observance of Rare Disease Day; now therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA, BOTH
HOUSES THEREOF CONCURRING, That we recognize February 28,
2018, and the last day in February in each succeeding year, as
Rare Disease Day in Alabama.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That February 2018 and every
February in each succeeding year be recognized as Rare Disease
Awareness month.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That this resolution be
provided for presentation as an expression of our sentiment in
this regard.
