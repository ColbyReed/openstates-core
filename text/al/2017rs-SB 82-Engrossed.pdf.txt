Relating to homicide; to establish the Marshall

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA:
Section 1. This act may be cited as the Marshall
James Walton Highway Safety Act.
Section 2. (a) A person who causes the death of
another person while knowingly engaged in the violation of
Title 32, Chapter 5A, excluding Section 32-5A-191, Code of
Alabama 1975, applying to the operation or use of a vehicle,
as defined in Section 32-1-1.1 (81) of the Code of Alabama
1975, may be guilty of homicide by vehicle or vessel when the
violation is the proximate cause of the death.
(b) A person convicted of homicide by vehicle under
subsection (a) is guilty of a Class C felony.
(c) By the tenth day of the 2022 Legislative Regular

Prosecution Services will report to the Legislature the
statistical information from court records relating to this

Section 3. Although this bill would have as its

requirements and application under Amendment 621, now
appearing as Section 111.05 of the Official Recompilation of
the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, as amended, because the
bill defines a new crime or amends the definition of an
