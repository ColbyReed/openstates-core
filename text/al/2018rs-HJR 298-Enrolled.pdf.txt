ENROLLED, House Joint Resolution,
COMMENDING DEPUTIES ANDY REED, HAYDEN CLEMENTS, AND
TYLER CLINE OF THE ETOWAH COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE AS
RECIPIENTS OF THE 2018 ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE MEDAL OF HONOR FOR
LAW ENFORCEMENT.
WHEREAS, it is with great pleasure that we present
Deputies Andy Reed, Hayden Clements, and Tyler Cline of the
Etowah County Sheriff's Office with the 2018 Alabama
Legislative Medal of Honor for Law Enforcement, Alabama's
highest law enforcement award for extraordinary courage in the
line of duty; and
WHEREAS, on May 26, 2017, while on duty at the
Etowah County Detention Center (ECDC), a multi-jurisdictional
correctional facility in Gadsden, Alabama, that houses all
levels of offenders, Deputies Andy Reed, Hayden Clements, and
Tyler Cline responded to a fire set by Immigration and Customs
Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainees in Unit 3, a maximum
security housing unit; since 1998, ECDC has housed some of the
most dangerous Immigration Detainees in the United States; on
this particular day, five Immigration Detainees from Iraq,
Cambodia, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Mali were plotting an alleged
escape attempt; all five were violent offenders who were in
the process of being deported to their native country; upon
the deputies' arrival, they found the unit on fire, saturated
with smoke, and filled with inmates; knowing that this unit
housed among the most ruthless individuals in the Detention
Center and that they were outnumbered three to one, the
deputies entered the unit without hesitation; unable to see
and forced to hold their breath each time, they entered the
unit time and time again until all persons were evacuated to a
safe area; after ensuring all were safe and the facility was
secure, these deputies continued their work, despite suffering
from smoke inhalation and exhaustion; the bravery and heroic
actions exhibited by these men saved 22 lives; their courage
and devotion to duty espouse the highest traditions of law
enforcement service and reflect great credit upon themselves,
the Etowah County Detention Center, and the Office of Sheriff,
Etowah County, Alabama; their actions further demonstrate
their love of country and their willingness to place their own
lives in harm's way to defend freedom; now therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA, BOTH
HOUSES THEREOF CONCURRING, That we hereby recognize and honor
Deputy Hayden Clements, Deputy Tyler Cline, and Lieutenant
Andy Reed as recipients of the 2018 Legislative Medal of Honor
for Law Enforcement and direct that they receive a copy of
this resolution as evidence of our admiration and esteem.
Speaker of the House of Representatives
