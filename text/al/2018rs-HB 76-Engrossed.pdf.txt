placing agency or the Department of Human Resources. Unless
otherwise provided in this chapter, no criminal history
background information check shall be conducted on a current
foster parent or household member of a foster family if a
Federal Bureau of Investigation and Alabama Department of
Public Safety State Law Enforcement Agency criminal history
background information check has already been conducted under
other law that meets the suitability criteria as provided in
this chapter. Subsequent arrests or convictions of foster
parents, or arrests or convictions entered into the automated
system subsequent to the initial report, shall be sent by the
Department of Public Safety Alabama State Law Enforcement
Agency to the Department of Human Resources as provided in
this chapter.
"(3) An applicant or employee, with the exception of
those individuals on employed status on November 1, 2000, in a
position in the Department of Human Resources which requires
unsupervised access to children, the elderly, or individuals
with disabilities as one of the essential functions of the
job. All current employees of the Department of Human
Resources shall be subjected to a criminal history background
information check upon reasonable suspicion. Criminal history
background information checks shall be required for
prospective and current personnel under contract with the
Department of Human Resources or working with another entity
under contract with the Department of Human Resources,
students, mentors, and volunteers in positions requiring
unsupervised access to children, the elderly, or persons with
disabilities as one of the essential functions of the job. The
Department of Human Resources shall pay any fees related to
checks required pursuant to this subdivision.
"(4) A current licensee or applicant for a license
through the Department of Human Resources to operate a child
care or adult care facility.
"(5) An adoptive parent applicant for a child
adoptive placement through the Department of Human Resources
or child placing agency and any Department of Human Resources
or child placing agency approved adoptive parent prior to
entry of a final decree of adoption. Unless otherwise provided
in this chapter, no criminal history background information
check shall be conducted on a current adoptive parent or
household member of an adoptive family if a Federal Bureau of
Investigation and Alabama Department of Public Safety State
Law Enforcement Agency criminal history background information
check has already been conducted under other law that meets
the suitability criteria as provided in this chapter.
Subsequent arrests or convictions of adoptive parents, or
arrests or convictions entered into the automated system
subsequent to the initial report, shall be sent by the
Department of Public Safety Alabama State Law Enforcement
Agency to the Department of Human Resources as elsewhere
provided in this chapter.
"(b) An employer, child care facility, adult care
facility, the Department of Human Resources, or a child
placing agency may only request a criminal history background
information check by its chief executive officer, or his or
her designee authorized in writing and notarized, and law
enforcement shall render assistance, including assistance in
obtaining fingerprints required for submission of a request to
the Department of Public Safety Alabama State Law Enforcement
Agency.
"(c) Every employee, volunteer or applicant, for
employment or a volunteer position, licensee, Department of
Human Resources adoptive parent applicant or approved adoptive
parent, or applicant for a license to the Department of Human
Resources to operate a child care or adult care facility shall
submit two sets of fingerprints and sign a written consent to
obtain the criminal history background information.
Fingerprints shall not be required when a disability prevents
a person from being fingerprinted. Disabilities preventing
fingerprinting include the loss of both hands, severe scarring
of all fingers, closed paralytic hands, and similar
disabilities. In cases involving disability, a written consent
to obtain available criminal history background information by
name only shall be obtained. No one who fails or refuses to
give written consent or submit fingerprints necessary to
obtain criminal history background information may be
employed, allowed to perform volunteer or other work, approved
or issued a license, or allowed to retain a license or
approval by the Department of Human Resources, an employer,
child care facility, adult care facility, or child placing
agency.
"(d) Child care facilities or adult Adult care
facilities exempt from Department of Human Resources licensing
shall not be required to comply with this chapter, but may
voluntarily collect and forward two complete acceptable sets
of fingerprints, the written consent, and nonrefundable fee
from applicants or employees to the Department of Public
Safety Alabama State Law Enforcement Agency to request a
criminal history background information check which shall be
processed pursuant to this chapter. Licensed social workers
conducting home studies may also request a criminal history
background check which shall be processed pursuant to this
chapter. Provided, however, if a license-exempt child care
facility operated as part of a church ministry or religious
school does not choose to comply with this chapter on a
voluntary basis, then the employee or prospective employee of
the child care facility shall request a criminal history
background check, and the request shall be processed in the
same manner as for other employees or applicants under the
provisions of this chapter. The Department of Human Resources
shall, prior to the disbursement of any subsidized child care
funds, require all employees and applicants of legally
operating child care facilities to submit verification of the
application for a criminal history background check and the
results thereof when obtained. Upon reasonable suspicion that
the individual has a criminal conviction or has not had a
criminal history background check conducted, the Department of
Human Resources shall have the right to require employees of
license-exempt child care or adult care facilities to submit
each application for a criminal history background check and
the results thereof when obtained."
