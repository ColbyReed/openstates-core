(a) A partnership may sue and be sued in the name of
the partnership.
(b) An action may be brought against the partnership
and, except as provided in Section 10A-8A-3.06, against any or
all of the partners in the same action or in separate actions.
(c) A judgment against a partnership is not by
itself a judgment against a partner. A judgment against a
partnership may not be satisfied from a partner's assets
unless there is also a judgment against the partner.
(d) A judgment creditor of a partner may not levy
execution against the assets of the partner to satisfy a
judgment based on a claim against the partnership unless the
claim is for a debt, obligation, or liability for which the
partner is personally liable as provided in Section
10A-8A-3.06 and either:
(1) a judgment based on the same claim has been
obtained against the partnership and a writ of execution on
the judgment has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in
part;
(2) the partnership is a debtor in bankruptcy;
(3) the partner has agreed that the creditor need
not exhaust partnership assets;
(4) a court grants permission to the judgment
creditor to levy execution against the assets of a partner
based on a finding that partnership assets subject to
execution are clearly insufficient to satisfy the judgment,
that exhaustion of partnership assets is excessively
burdensome, or that the grant of permission is an appropriate
exercise of the court's equitable powers; or
(5) liability is imposed on the partner by law or
contract independent of the existence of the partnership.
(e) This section applies to any partnership
liability or obligation resulting from a representation by a
partner or purported partner under Section 10A-8A-3.08.
ยง10A-8A-3.08. Liability of purported partner.
Except as provided in Section 10A-8A-3.06: (a) If a
person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner, or
consents to being represented by another as a partner, in a
partnership or with one or more persons not partners, the
purported partner is liable to a person to whom the
representation is made, if that person, relying on the
representation, enters into a transaction with the actual or
purported partnership. If the representation, either by the
purported partner or by a person with the purported partner's
consent, is made in a public manner, the purported partner is
liable to a person who relies upon the purported partnership
even if the purported partner is not aware of being held out
as a partner to the claimant. If partnership liability
results, the purported partner is liable with respect to that
liability as if the purported partner were a partner. If no
partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable
with respect to that liability jointly and severally with any
other person consenting to the representation.
(b) If a person is thus represented to be a partner
in an existing partnership, or with one or more persons not
partners, the purported partner is an agent of persons
consenting to the representation to bind them to the same
extent and in the same manner as if the purported partner were
a partner, with respect to persons who enter into transactions
in reliance upon the representation. If all of the partners of
the existing partnership consent to the representation, a
partnership act or obligation results. If fewer than all of
the partners of the existing partnership consent to the
representation, the person acting and the partners consenting
to the representation are jointly and severally liable.
(c) A person is not liable as a partner merely
because the person is named by another in a statement of
authority.
(d) A person does not continue to be liable as a
partner merely because of a failure to file a statement of
dissociation or to amend a statement of authority to indicate
the partner's dissociation from the partnership.
(e) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (a)
and (b), persons who are not partners as to each other are not
liable as partners to other persons.
Article 4. Relations of Partners to Each Other and
to Partnership.
ยง10A-8A-4.01. Partner's rights and duties.
(a) Each partner is deemed to have an account that
is:
(1) credited with an amount equal to the money plus
the value of any other property, net of the amount of any
liabilities, the partner contributes to the partnership and
the partner's share of the partnership profits; and
(2) charged with an amount equal to the money plus
the value of any other property, net of the amount of any
liabilities, distributed by the partnership to the partner and
the partner's share of the partnership losses provided that a
partner shall not be charged with any share of partnership
loss attributable to a debt, obligation or liability for which
the partner is not personally liable under Section 10A-8A-3.06
unless the loss is satisfied out of partnership assets.
(b) Each partner is entitled to an equal share of
the partnership profits and, subject to the limitations in
subsection (a)(2) of this section, is chargeable with a share
of the partnership losses in proportion to the partner's share
of the profits.
(c) A partnership shall reimburse a partner for
payments made and indemnify a partner for liabilities incurred
by the partner in the ordinary course of the business or not
for profit activity of the partnership or for the preservation
of its business or not for profit activity or property;
provided, however, no partner in a limited liability
partnership shall be required as a consequence of the
indemnification to make any payment on behalf of the limited
liability partnership to any other partners to the extent that
the payment would be inconsistent with Sections 10A-8A-3.06,
10A-8A-8.06, or 10A-8A-8.07.
(d) A partnership shall reimburse a partner for an
advance beyond the amount of capital the partner agreed to
contribute.
(e) A payment or advance made by a partner which
gives rise to a partnership obligation under subsection (c) or
(d) constitutes a loan to the partnership which accrues
interest from the date of the payment or advance.
(f) Each partner has equal rights in the management
and conduct of the partnership business or not for profit
activity.
(g) A partner may use or possess partnership
property only on behalf of the partnership.
(h) A partner is not entitled to remuneration for
services performed for the partnership, except for reasonable
compensation for services rendered in winding up the business
or not for profit activity of the partnership.
(i) A difference arising as to a matter in the
ordinary course of business or not for profit activity of a
partnership may be decided by a majority of the partners. An
act outside the ordinary course of business or not for profit
activity of a partnership and an amendment to the partnership
agreement may be undertaken only with the consent of all of
the partners.
(j) This section does not affect the obligations of
a partnership to other persons under Section 10A-8A-3.01.
ยง10A-8A-4.02. Admission of partner.
(a) The initial partners of a partnership are
admitted as partners upon the formation of the partnership.
(b) After formation, a person is admitted as a
partner of the partnership:
(1) as provided in the partnership agreement;
(2) as the result of a transaction effective under
Article 9 of this chapter or Article 8 of Chapter 1;
(3) with the consent of all the partners; or
(4) as provided in Section 10A-8A-8.01(6) or
10A-8A-8.01(7).
(c) Each person to be admitted as a partner to a
partnership formed under either Section 10A-8A-2.01(a)(i) or
10A-8A-2.01(a)(ii) may be admitted as a partner without:
(1) acquiring a transferable interest; or
(2) making or being obligated to make a contribution
to the partnership.
ยง10A-8A-4.03. Form of contribution. A contribution
by a partner may be made to a partnership as agreed by the
partners.
ยง10A-8A-4.04. Liability for contribution.
(a) A partner's obligation to make a contribution to
a partnership is not excused by the partner's death,
disability, or other inability to perform personally.
(b) If a partner does not make a contribution
required by an enforceable promise, the partner or the
partner's estate is obligated, at the election of the
partnership, to contribute money equal to the value of the
portion of the contribution that has not been made. The
foregoing election shall be in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any other rights, including the right to specific
performance, that the partnership may have under the
partnership agreement or applicable law.
(c) The obligation of a partner to make a
contribution to a partnership may be compromised only by
consent of all partners. A conditional obligation of a partner
to make a contribution to a partnership may not be enforced
unless the conditions of the obligation have been satisfied or
waived as to or by that partner. Conditional obligations
include contributions payable upon a discretionary call of a
partnership before the time the call occurs.
(d) A creditor of a limited liability partnership
which extends credit or otherwise acts in reliance on an
obligation described in subsection (a), without notice of any
compromise under this subsection, may enforce the original
obligation.
(e) A promise by a partner to make a contribution to
a partnership is not enforceable unless set forth in a writing
signed by the partner.
ยง10A-8A-4.05. Sharing of distributions before
dissolution. All partners shall share equally in any
distributions made by a partnership before its dissolution and
winding up.
ยง10A-8A-4.06. Interim distributions. Subject to
Section 10A-8A-7.01, a partner has a right to a distribution
before the dissolution and winding up of a partnership as
provided in the partnership agreement. A decision to make a
distribution before the dissolution and winding up of the
partnership is a decision in the ordinary course of the
business or not for profit activity of the partnership.
ยง10A-8A-4.07. Distribution in kind. A partner does
not have a right to demand and receive a distribution from a
partnership in any form other than money. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 10A-8A-8.07, a partnership may distribute
an asset in kind if each partner receives a percentage of the
asset in proportion to the partner's share of distributions.
ยง10A-8A-4.08. Right to distribution. If a partner
becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the partner has
the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a
creditor of the partnership with respect to the distribution.
However, the partnership's obligation to make a distribution
is subject to offset for any amount owed to the partnership by
the partner or dissociated partner on whose account the
distribution is made.
ยง10A-8A-4.09. Limitations on distribution and
liability for improper distributions.
(a) A limited liability partnership shall not make a
distribution to a partner to the extent that at the time of
the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all
liabilities of the limited liability partnership, other than
liabilities to partners on account of their transferable
interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors
is limited to specific property of the limited liability
partnership, exceed the fair value of the assets of the
limited liability partnership, except that the fair value of
the property that is subject to a liability for which recourse
of creditors is limited shall be included in the assets of the
limited liability partnership only to the extent that the fair
value of the property exceeds that liability.
(b) A partner who consents to a distribution in
violation of subsection (a) or the partnership agreement, and
who knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution
violated subsection (a) or the partnership agreement, shall be
liable to the limited liability partnership for the amount of
that distribution.
(c) A partner who receives a distribution in
violation of subsection (a) or the partnership agreement, and
who knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution
violated subsection (a) or the partnership agreement, shall be
liable to the limited liability partnership for the amount of
the distribution received by that partner. A partner who
receives a distribution in violation of subsection (a) or the
partnership agreement, and who did not know at the time of the
distribution that the distribution violated subsection (a) or
the partnership agreement, shall not be liable for the amount
of the distribution received by that partner.
(d) Except as provided in subsection (e), this
section shall not affect any obligation or liability of a
partner under other applicable law for the amount of a
distribution.
(e) An action under this section or other applicable
law is barred if not commenced within two years after the
distribution.
(f) For purposes of subsection (a), "distribution"
does not include amounts constituting reasonable compensation
for present or past services or reasonable payments made in
the ordinary course of the limited liability partnership's
business or not for profit activity under a bona fide
retirement plan or other benefits program.
(g) This section shall not apply to distributions
made in accordance with Section 10A-8A-8.09.

information.
Notwithstanding Sections 10A-1-3.32 and 10A-1-3.33:
(a) Subject to subsection (f), a partner, without
having any particular purpose for seeking the information, may
inspect and copy during regular hours at a reasonable location
specified by the partnership, required information and any
other records maintained by the partnership regarding the
partnership's business or not for profit activity and
financial condition.
(b) Subject to subsection (f), each partner and the
partnership shall furnish to a partner:
(1) without demand, any information concerning the
partnership's business or not for profit activity reasonably
required for the proper exercise of the partner's rights and
duties under the partnership agreement or this chapter; and
(2) on demand, any other information concerning the
partnership's business or not for profit activity, except to
the extent the demand or the information demanded is
unreasonable or otherwise improper under the circumstances.
(c) Subject to subsections (e) and (f), on 10 days'
demand made in a writing received by the partnership, a person
dissociated as a partner may have access to the information
and records described in subsection (a) at the location
specified in subsection (a) if:
(1) the information or writing pertains to the
period during which the person was a partner;
(2) the person seeks the information or record in
good faith; and
(3) it is determined that:
(i) the person seeks the information for a purpose
reasonably related to the person's interest as a partner;

to subsection (c), the partnership in a writing shall inform
the person that made the demand:

(f) In addition to any restriction or condition
stated in its partnership agreement, a partnership, as to a
matter within the ordinary course of its business or not for
profit activity, may:
(1) impose reasonable restrictions and conditions on
access to and use of information to be furnished under this
section, including designating information confidential and
imposing nondisclosure and safeguarding obligations on the
recipient; and
(2) keep confidential from the partners and any
other person, for such period of time as the partnership deems
reasonable, any information that the partnership reasonably
believes to be in the nature of trade secrets or other
information the disclosure of which the partnership in good
faith believes is not in the best interest of the partnership
or could damage the partnership or its business or not for
profit activity, or that the partnership is required by law or
by agreement with a third party to keep confidential.
In any dispute concerning the reasonableness of a
restriction under this subsection, the partnership has the
burden of proving reasonableness.
(g) A partnership may charge a person that makes a
demand under this section reasonable costs of copying, limited
to the costs of labor and material.
(h) A partner or person dissociated as a partner may
exercise the rights under this section through an attorney or
other agent. Any restriction imposed under subsection (f) or
by the partnership agreement applies both to the attorney or
other agent and to the partner or person dissociated as a
partner.
(i) The rights under this section do not extend to a
person as transferee, but the rights under subsection (c) of a
person dissociated as a partner may be exercised by the legal
representative of an individual who dissociated as a partner
under Section 10A-8A-6.01(6).
(j) Any partner who, without reasonable cause,
refuses to allow any partner or person dissociated as a
partner, or their agent or attorney to inspect or copy any
records of the partnership to which such partner or person
dissociated as a partner is entitled under this section, shall
be personally liable to the partner or person dissociated as a
partner for a penalty in an amount not to exceed 10 percent of
the fair market value of the transferable interest of the
partner or person dissociated as a partner, in addition to any
other damages or remedy.
ยง10A-8A-4.11. General standards of partner's
conduct.
(a) The duties that a partner has to the partnership
and to the other partners include the duty of loyalty and the
duty of care as described in subsections (b) and (c).
(b) A partner's duty of loyalty to the partnership
and to the other partners includes each of the following:
(1) to account to the partnership and to hold as
trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived by the
partner in the conduct or winding up of the partnership's
business or not for profit activity or derived from a use by
the partner of partnership property, including the
appropriation of a partnership opportunity;
(2) to refrain from dealing with the partnership in
the conduct or winding up of the partnership's business or not
for profit activity as or on behalf of a party having an
interest adverse to the partnership; and
(3) to refrain from competing with the partnership
in the conduct or winding up of the partnership's business or
not for profit activity.
(c) A partner's duty of care to the partnership and
to the other partners in the conduct or winding up of the
partnership's business or not for profit activity includes
refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless
conduct, intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of
law.
(d) A partner shall discharge the duties to the
partnership and to the other partners under this chapter and
under the partnership agreement and exercise any rights
consistently with the implied contractual covenant of good
faith and fair dealing.
(e) A partner does not violate a duty or obligation
under this chapter or under the partnership agreement merely
because the partner's conduct furthers the partner's own
interest.
ยง10A-8A-4.12. Reliance on reports and information. A
partner of a partnership shall be fully protected in relying
in good faith upon the records of the partnership and upon
information, opinions, reports, or statements presented by
another partner or agent of the partnership, or by any other
person as to matters the partner reasonably believes are
within that other person's professional or expert competence,
including information, opinions, reports, or statements as to
the value and amount of the assets, liabilities, profits, or
losses of the partnership, or the value and amount of assets
or reserves or contracts, agreements, or other undertakings
that would be sufficient to pay claims and obligations of the
partnership, or to make reasonable provision to pay those
claims and obligations, or any other facts pertinent to the
existence and amount of assets from which distributions to
partners or creditors might properly be paid.
ยง10A-8A-4.13. Actions by partnership and partners.
(a) Except as provided in Sections 10A-8A-3.06,
10A-8A-8.06, or 10A-8A-8.07, a partnership may maintain an
action against a partner for a breach of the partnership
agreement, or for the violation of a duty to the partnership,
causing harm to the partnership.
(b) Except as provided in Sections 10A-8A-3.06,
10A-8A-8.06, or 10A-8A-8.07, a partner may maintain an action
against the partnership or another partner for legal or
equitable relief, with or without an accounting as to

interests of the partner, including rights and interests
arising independently of the partnership relationship.
(c) The accrual of, and any time limitation on, a
right of action for a remedy under this section is governed by
other law. A right to an accounting upon a dissolution and
winding up does not revive a claim barred by law.
ยง10A-8A-4.14. Continuation of partnership beyond
definite term or particular undertaking.
(a) If a partnership for a definite term or
particular undertaking is continued, without an express
agreement, after the expiration of the term or completion of
the undertaking, the rights and duties of the partners remain
the same as they were at the expiration or completion, so far
as is consistent with a partnership at will.
(b) If the partners, or those of them who habitually
acted in the business or not for profit activity during the
term or undertaking, continue the business or not for profit
activity without any settlement or liquidation of the
partnership, they are presumed to have agreed that the

Article 5. Transferees and Creditors of Partners.
ยง10A-8A-5.01. Partner's transferable interest in
partnership. The only interest of a partner which is
transferable is the partner's transferable interest. A
transferable interest is personal property.
ยง10A-8A-5.02. Transfer of partner's transferable
interest.
(a) A transfer, in whole or in part, of a partner's
transferable interest:
(1) is permissible;
(2) does not by itself cause the partner's
dissociation;
(3) does not by itself cause a dissolution and
winding up of the partnership; and
(4) subject to Section 10A-8A-5.05, does not entitle
the transferee to:
(A) participate in the management or conduct of the
partnership's business or not for profit activity; or
(B) except as otherwise provided in subsection (d),
have access to required information, records, or other
information concerning the partnership's business or not for
profit activity.
(b) A transferee has a right:
(1) to receive, in accordance with the transfer,
distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be
entitled;
(2) to receive upon the dissolution and winding up
of the partnership, in accordance with the transfer, the net
amount otherwise distributable to the transferor; and
(3) to seek under Section 10A-8A-8.01(5) a judicial
determination that it is equitable to wind up the partnership
business or not for profit activity.
(c) A transferable interest may be evidenced by a
certificate of transferable interest issued by the
partnership. A partnership agreement may provide for the
transfer of the transferable interest represented by the
certificate and make other provisions with respect to the
certificate. No certificate of transferable interest shall be
issued in bearer form.
(d) In a dissolution and winding up, a transferee is
entitled to an account of the partnership's transactions only
from the date of dissolution.
(e) Except as otherwise provided in Sections
10A-8A-6.01(4), 10A-8A-6.01(11), and 10A-9A-6.01(12), when a
partner transfers a transferable interest, the transferor
retains the rights of a partner other than the right to
distributions transferred and retains all duties and
obligations of a partner.
(f) A partnership need not give effect to a
transferee's rights under this section until the partnership
has notice of the transfer.
(g) When a partner transfers a transferable interest
to a person that is admitted as a partner with respect to the
transferred interest, the transferee is liable for the
partner's obligations under Sections 10A-8A-4.04 and
10A-8A-4.09 to the extent that the obligations are known to
the transferee when the transferee voluntarily accepts
admission as a partner.
ยง10A-8A-5.03. Rights of creditor of partner or
transferee.
(a) On application to a court of competent
jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a partner or
transferee, the court may charge the transferable interest of
the judgment debtor with payment of the unsatisfied amount of
the judgment with interest. To the extent so charged and after
the partnership has been served with the charging order, the
judgment creditor has only the right to receive any
distribution or distributions to which the judgment debtor
would otherwise be entitled in respect of the transferable
interest.
(b) The partnership, after being served with a
charging order and its terms, shall be entitled to pay or
deposit any distribution or distributions to which the
judgment debtor would otherwise be entitled in respect of the
charged transferable interest into the hands of the clerk of
the court so issuing the charging order, and the payment or
deposit shall discharge the partnership and the judgment
debtor from liability for the amount so paid or deposited and
any interest that might accrue thereon. Upon receipt of the
payment or deposit, the clerk of the court shall notify the
judgment creditor of the receipt of the payment or deposit.
The judgment creditor shall, after any payment or deposit into
the court, petition the court for payment of so much of the
amount paid or deposited as is held by the court as may be
necessary to pay the judgment creditor's judgment. To the
extent the court has excess amounts paid or deposited on hand
after the payment to the judgment creditor, the excess amounts
paid or deposited shall be distributed to the judgment debtor
and the charging order shall be extinguished. The court, may
in its discretion, order the clerk to deposit, pending the
judgment creditor's petition, any money paid or deposited with
the clerk, in an interest bearing account at a bank authorized
to receive deposits of public funds.
(c) A charging order constitutes a lien on the
judgment debtor's transferable interest.
(d) Subject to subsection (c):
(1) a judgment debtor that is a partner retains the
rights of a partner and remains subject to all duties and
obligations of a partner; and
(2) a judgment debtor that is a transferee retains
the rights of a transferee and remains subject to all duties
and obligations of a transferee.
(e) This chapter does not deprive any partner or
transferee of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to
the partner's or transferee's transferable interest.
(f) This section provides the exclusive remedy by
which a judgment creditor of a partner or transferee may
satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's transferable
interest and the judgment creditor shall have no right to
foreclose, under this chapter or any other law, upon the
charging order, the charging order lien, or the judgment
debtor's transferable interest. A judgment creditor of a
partner or transferee shall have no right to obtain possession
of, or otherwise exercise legal or equitable remedies with
respect to, the property of a partnership. Court orders for
actions or requests for accounts and inquiries that the
judgment debtor might have made, are not available to the
judgment creditor attempting to satisfy the judgment out of
the judgment debtor's transferable interest and may not be
ordered by a court.
ยง10A-8A-5.04. Power of personal representative of
deceased partner.
If a partner dies, the deceased partner's personal
representative or other legal representative may:

partner's personal representative or other legal
representative holds the deceased partner's transferable
interest:

interests under this chapter;
(2) exercise the rights of a transferee under
Section 10A-8A-5.02; and

(b) for the period of time that the deceased
partner's personal representative or other legal
representative does not hold the deceased partner's
transferable interest, for purposes of settling the estate,
exercise the rights of a person dissociated as a partner under
Section 10A-8A-4.10.

A person is dissociated from a partnership as a
partner upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
(1) the partnership has notice of the person's

or particular undertaking, before the expiration of the term
or the completion of the undertaking if any of the following

Article 7. Person's Dissociation as a Partner when
Business or Not for Profit Activity Not Wound up.
ยง10A-8A-7.01. Purchase of transferable interest of a
person dissociated as a partner.
(a) If a person is dissociated as a partner from a
partnership without resulting in a dissolution and winding up
of the partnership business or not for profit activity under
Section 10A-8A-8.01, the partnership shall cause that person's
transferable interest in the partnership owned by that person
at the time of dissociation to be purchased for a buyout price
determined pursuant to subsection (b).
(b) The buyout price of the transferable interest
owned by the person at the time of dissociation as a partner
is an amount equal to the fair value of that person's
transferable interest as of the date of dissociation. Interest
on the buyout price must be paid from the date of dissociation
to the date of payment.
(c) Damages for wrongful dissociation under Sections
10A-8A-6.02(b) and (c), and all other amounts owing, whether
or not presently due, from the person dissociated as a partner
to the partnership, must be offset against the buyout price.
Interest on damages for wrongful dissociation must be paid
from the date of the wrongful dissociation to the date of
payment. Interest on all other amounts, whether or not
presently due, must be paid from the date the amount owed
becomes due to the date of payment.
(d) A partnership shall indemnify a person
dissociated as a partner whose transferable interest is being
purchased against all partnership liabilities, whether
incurred before or after the dissociation, except liabilities
incurred by an act of the person dissociated as a partner
under Section 10A-8A-7.02.
(e) If no agreement for the purchase of the
transferable interests of a person dissociated as a partner is
reached within 120 days after a written demand for payment,
the partnership shall pay, or cause to be paid, in cash to the
person dissociated as a partner the amount the partnership
estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced
by any offsets and accrued interest under subsection (c).
(f) If a deferred payment is authorized under
subsection (h), the partnership may tender a written offer to
pay the amount it estimates to be the buyout price and accrued
interest, reduced by any offsets under subsection (c), stating
the time of payment, the amount and type of security for
payment, and the other terms and conditions of the obligation.
(g) The payment or tender required by subsection (e)
or (f) must be accompanied by the following:
(1) a written statement of partnership assets and
liabilities as of the date of dissociation;
(2) the latest available partnership balance sheet
and income statement, if any;
(3) a written explanation of how the estimated
amount of the payment was calculated; and
(4) written notice which shall state that the
payment is in full satisfaction of the obligation to purchase
unless, within 120 days after the written notice, the person
dissociated as a partner commences an action to determine the
buyout price of that person's transferable interest, any
offsets under subsection (c), or other terms of the obligation
to purchase.
(h) A person that wrongfully dissociates as a
partner before the expiration of a definite term or the
completion of a particular undertaking is not entitled to
payment of any portion of the buyout price until the
expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking,
unless the person establishes to the satisfaction of the court
that earlier payment will not cause undue hardship to the
business or not for profit activity of the partnership. A
deferred payment under this subsection must bear interest and,
to the extent it would not cause undue hardship to the
business or not for profit activity of the partnership, be
adequately secured.
(i) A person dissociated as a partner may maintain
an action against the partnership, pursuant to Section
10A-8A-4.13(b)(2)(ii), to determine the buyout price of that
person's transferable interest under subsection (b), any
offsets under subsection (c), or other terms of the obligation
to purchase. The action must be commenced within 120 days
after the partnership has tendered payment or an offer to pay
or within one year after written demand for payment if no
payment or offer to pay is tendered. The court shall determine
the buyout price of that person's transferable interest under
subsection (b), any offset due under subsection (c), and
accrued interest, and enter judgment for any additional
payment or refund. If deferred payment is authorized under
subsection (h), the court shall also determine the security,
if any, for payment and other terms of the obligation to
purchase. The court may assess reasonable attorney's fees and
the fees and expenses of appraisers or other experts for a
party to the action, in amounts the court finds equitable,
against a party that the court finds acted arbitrarily,
vexatiously, or not in good faith. The finding may be based on
the partnership's failure to tender payment or an offer to pay
or to comply with subsection (g).
ยง10A-8A-7.02. Power to bind and liability of person
dissociated as a partner.
(a) For one year after a person dissociates as a
partner without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of
the partnership business or not for profit activity, the
partnership, including a surviving partnership or other
surviving entity under Article 9 of this chapter and Article 8
of Chapter 1, is bound by an act of the person dissociated as
a partner which would have bound the partnership under Section
10A-8A-3.01 before dissociation only if at the time of
entering into the transaction the other party:
(1) reasonably believed that the person dissociated
as a partner was then a partner and reasonably relied on such
belief in entering into the transaction;
(2) did not have notice of the person's dissociation
as a partner; and
(3) is not deemed to have had knowledge or notice
under Section 10A-8A-1.03.

the partnership for any damage caused to the partnership
arising from an obligation incurred by the person dissociated
as a partner after dissociation for which the partnership is
liable under subsection (a).
ยง10A-8A-7.03. Liability of person dissociated as a
partner to other persons.
(a) A person's dissociation as a partner does not of
itself discharge that person's liability for a partnership
obligation incurred before dissociation. A person dissociated
as a partner is not liable for a partnership obligation
incurred after dissociation, except as provided in subsection
(b).
(b) A person that dissociates as a partner without
resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership
business or not for profit activity is liable as a partner to
the other party in a transaction entered into by the
partnership, or a surviving partnership or other surviving
entity under Article 9 of this chapter or Article 8 of Chapter
1, within one year after the partner's dissociation, only if
the partner is liable for the obligation under Section
10A-8A-3.06 and at the time of entering into the transaction
the other party:
(1) reasonably believed that the person dissociated
as a partner was then a partner and reasonably relied on such
belief in entering into the transaction;
(2) did not have notice of the person's
dissociation; and
(3) is not deemed to have had knowledge or notice
under Section 10A-8A-1.03 of the person's dissociation.

the partners continuing the business or not for profit
activity, a person dissociated as a partner may be released
from liability for a partnership obligation.
(d) A person dissociated as a partner is released
from liability for a partnership obligation if a partnership
creditor, with notice of the person's dissociation but without
the person's consent, agrees to a material alteration in the
nature or time of payment of a partnership obligation.
ยง10A-8A-7.04. Statement of dissociation.
(a) A person dissociated as a partner or the
partnership may file a statement of dissociation stating the
name of the partnership and that the person is dissociated as
a partner from the partnership.
(b) A statement of dissociation is a limitation on
the authority of a person dissociated as a partner for the
purposes of Section10A-8A-3.03.
ยง10A-8A-7.05. Continued use of partnership name.
Continued use of a partnership name, or a person's name that
is dissociated as a partner as part thereof, by partners
continuing the business or not for profit activity does not of
itself make the person dissociated as a partner liable for an
obligation of the partners or the partnership continuing the
business or not for profit activity.
Article 8. Dissolution and Winding Up.
ยง10A-8A-8.01. Events of dissolution.
A partnership is dissolved, and its business or not
for profit activity must be wound up, upon the occurrence of
the first of the following events:

specified a dissociation date later than the date the
partnership knew or had notice, on the later date;

affirmatively consent to dissolve the partnership and wind up
the partnership business or not for profit activity, for which
purpose a partner's rightful dissociation pursuant to Section
10A-8A-6.02(b)(2)(A) constitutes the expression of that
partner's will to wind up the business or not for profit
activity of the partnership;
(ii) the consent of all of the partners to dissolve
and wind up the partnership's business or not for profit
activity; or
(iii) the expiration of the term or the completion

or particular undertaking at the time of the transfer; or
(ii) at any time, if the partnership was a

not for profit activity of the partnership and to admit two or
more new partners; or

partnership is continued and two or more new partners are
admitted in the manner stated in the partnership agreement.

(b) If a dissolved partnership does not have a
partner and no person has the right to participate in winding
up under subsection (a), the personal or legal representative
of the last person to have been a partner may wind up the
partnership's business or not for profit activity. If the

time following the dissolution the person appointed pursuant
to subsection (b) is not winding up the business or not for
profit activity of the partnership; or
(4) in connection with a proceeding under Section
10A-8A-8.01(4) or (5).
(d) A person appointed under subsection (b) or (c)
is not a partner but:
(1) has the powers of a partner under Section
10A-8A-8.04 but is not liable for the debts, liabilities, and
other obligations of the partnership solely by reason of
having or exercising those powers or otherwise acting to wind
up the business or not for profit activity of the dissolved
partnership; and
(2) shall promptly deliver to the Secretary of State

profit activity of the dissolved partnership.

dissolution.

act of a partner or by the act of a dissociated partner acting
as a partner under Section 10A-8A-8.03(a) which:
(1) is appropriate for winding up the partnership's
business or not for profit activity; or
(2) would have bound the partnership under Section
10A-8A-3.01 before dissolution, if, at the time the other
party enters into the transaction, the other party does not
have notice of the dissolution.
(b) Subject to subsection (a), a person dissociated
as a partner binds a partnership through an act occurring
after dissolution only if:
(1) at the time the other party enters into the
transaction the other party does not have notice of the
dissociation and reasonably believes that the person is a
partner; and
(2) the act:
(A) is appropriate for winding up the partnership's
business or not for profit activity; or
(B) would have bound the partnership under Section
10A-8A-3.01 before dissolution and at the time the other party
enters into the transaction the other party does not have
notice of the dissolution.
ยง10A-8A-8.05. Liability after dissolution of partner

dissociated as partners.

partner is liable for the obligation, to the partner or other
person for any damage caused to the partner or other person

permits the person to participate in winding up; and
(2) the act that causes the partnership to be bound
under Section 10A-8A-8.04(b) is appropriate for winding up the
partnership's business or not for profit activity.

partnership.

limiting actions, a claim against a dissolved partnership is
barred:

"claim" includes unliquidated claims, but does not include a
contingent liability that has not matured so that there is no
immediate right to bring suit or a claim based on an event
occurring after the effective date of dissolution.

notice in accordance with subsection (b), unless sooner barred

any other statute limiting actions, or Section 10A-8A-8.06 may
be enforced:
(1) against a partnership, to the extent of its
undistributed assets;
(2) except as provided in subsection (h), if the
assets of a dissolved partnership have been distributed after
dissolution, against the person or persons owning the
transferable interests to the extent of that person's
proportionate share of the claim or of the assets distributed

person's total liability for all claims under subsection (d)
may not exceed the total amount of assets distributed to that
person after dissolution of the partnership; or

partnership or that are based on an event occurring after the
effective date of the dissolution of the partnership but that,
based on the facts known to the dissolved partnership, are
reasonably estimated to arise after the effective date of the
dissolution of the partnership. Provision need not be made for
any claim that is or is reasonably anticipated to be barred
under subsection (c).
(f) Within 10 days after the filing of the
application provided for in subsection (e), notice of the
proceeding shall be given by the dissolved partnership to each

additionally contributed. A person's liability under this
subsection may not exceed the amount the person failed to
contribute.

for the person's obligations under this section.

upon the later of:
(A) the filing of the statement of merger with the
Secretary of State; or
(B) as specified in the statement of merger; or
(2) if the surviving organization is not a
partnership, as provided by the governing statute of the

(f) After a merger becomes effective, if the

under Chapter 1.
(i) Except as provided in the last two sentences of
subsection (d), the filing fees for a statement of merger
shall be the same fees as provided in Section
10A-1-4.31(a)(5).
ยง10A-8A-9.09. Effect of merger.
(a) When a merger becomes effective:
(1) the surviving organization continues or, in the
case of a surviving organization created pursuant to the
merger, comes into existence;
(2) each constituent organization that merges into
the surviving organization ceases to exist as a separate
entity;
(3) all property owned by each constituent
organization that ceases to exist vests in the surviving
organization without reservation or impairment and the title
to any property vested by deed or otherwise in the surviving
organization shall not revert or be in any way impaired by
reason of the merger;
(4) all debts, obligations or other liabilities of
each constituent organization that ceases to exist continue as
debts, obligations or other liabilities of the surviving
organization and neither the rights of creditors, nor any
liens upon the property of any constituent organization, shall
be impaired by the merger;
(5) an action or proceeding pending by or against
any constituent organization continues as if the merger had
not occurred;
(6) except as prohibited by law other than this
chapter, all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
and purposes of each constituent organization vest in the
surviving organization;
(7) except as otherwise provided in the plan of
merger, the terms and conditions of the plan of merger take
effect;
(8) except as otherwise agreed, if a constituent
partnership ceases to exist, the merger does not dissolve the
partnership;
(9) if the surviving organization is created
pursuant to the merger:
(A) if it is a partnership, the statement of
partnership, statement of not for profit partnership or
statement of limited liability partnership becomes effective;
or
(B) if it is an organization other than a
partnership, the organizational document that creates the
organization becomes effective; and
(10) if the surviving organization existed before
the merger, any amendments provided for in the statement of
merger for the organizational document of that organization
become effective.
(b) A surviving organization that is a foreign
entity consents to the jurisdiction of this state to enforce
any debt, obligation, or other liability owed by a constituent
organization, if before the merger the constituent
organization was subject to suit in this state on the debt,
obligation, or other liability. If a surviving organization
that is a foreign entity fails to designate or maintain a
registered agent, or the designated registered agent cannot
with reasonable diligence be served, then the service of
process on that surviving organization for the purposes of
enforcing a debt, obligation, or other liability under this
subsection may be made in the same manner and has the same
consequences as provided in Section 10A-1-5.35.
ยง10A-8A-9.10. Restrictions on approval of mergers,
conversions and on relinquishing LLP status.
(a) If a partner of a converting or constituent
partnership will have personal liability with respect to a
converted or surviving organization, approval and amendment of
a plan of conversion or plan of merger are ineffective without
that partner's consent to the plan.
(b) A statement of cancellation of the statement of
limited liability partnership filed in connection with a
conversion or merger is ineffective without each partner's
written consent to such amendment.
(c) A partner does not give the consent required by
subsection (a) or (b) merely by consenting to a provision of
the partnership agreement that permits the partnership
agreement to be amended with the consent of fewer than all the
partners.
ยง10A-8A-9.11. Liability of partner after conversion
or merger.
(a) A conversion or merger under this article does
not discharge any liability under Sections 10A-8A-3.06,
10A-8A-7.02, or 10A-8A-7.03 of a person that was a partner in
or dissociated as a partner from a converting or constituent
partnership, but:
(1) the provisions of this chapter pertaining to the
collection or discharge of the liability continue to apply to
the liability;
(2) for the purposes of applying those provisions,
the converted or surviving organization is deemed to be the
converting or constituent partnership; and
(3) if a person is required to pay any amount under
this subsection:
(A) the person has a right of contribution from each
other person that was liable as a partner under Section
10A-8A-3.06 when the obligation was incurred and has not been
released from the obligation under Sections 10A-8A-7.02 or
10A-8A-7.03; and
(B) the contribution due from each of those persons
is in proportion to the right to receive distributions in the
capacity of partner in effect for each of those persons when
the obligation was incurred.
(b) In addition to any other liability provided by
law:
(1) a person that immediately before a conversion or
merger became effective was a partner in a converting or
constituent partnership that was not a limited liability
partnership is personally liable for each obligation of the
converted or surviving organization arising from a transaction
with a third party after the conversion or merger becomes
effective, if, at the time the third party enters into the
transaction, the third party:
(A) does not have notice of the conversion or
merger; and
(B) reasonably believes that:
(i) the converted or surviving business is the
converting or constituent partnership;
(ii) the converting or constituent partnership is
not a limited liability partnership; and
(iii) the person is a partner in the converting or
constituent partnership; and
(2) a person that was dissociated as a partner from
a converting or constituent partnership before the conversion
or merger became effective is personally liable for each
obligation of the converted or surviving organization arising
from a transaction with a third party after the conversion or
merger becomes effective, if:
(A) immediately before the conversion or merger
became effective the converting or surviving partnership was
not a limited liability partnership; and
(B) at the time the third party enters into the
transaction the third party:
(i) does not have notice of the dissociation;
(ii) does not have notice of the conversion or
merger; and
(iii) reasonably believes that the converted or
surviving organization is the converting or constituent
partnership, the converting or constituent partnership is not

in the converting or constituent partnership.
ยง10A-8A-9.12. Power of partners and persons
dissociated as partners to bind organization after conversion
or merger.
(a) An act of a person that immediately before a
conversion or merger became effective was a partner in a
converting or constituent partnership binds the converted or
surviving organization after the conversion or merger becomes
effective, if:
(1) before the conversion or merger became
effective, the act would have bound the converting or
constituent partnership under Section 10A-8A-3.01; and
(2) at the time the third party enters into the
transaction, the third party:
(A) does not have notice of the conversion or
merger; and
(B) reasonably believes that the converted or
surviving organization is the converting or constituent
partnership and that the person is a partner in the converting
or constituent partnership.
(b) An act of a person that before a conversion or
merger became effective was dissociated as a partner from a
converting or constituent partnership binds the converted or
surviving organization after the conversion or merger becomes
effective, if:
(1) before the conversion or merger became
effective, the act would have bound the converting or
constituent partnership under Section 10A-8A-3.01 if the
person had been a partner; and
(2) at the time the third party enters into the
transaction, the third party:
(A) does not have notice of the dissociation;
(B) does not have notice of the conversion or
merger; and
(C) reasonably believes that the converted or
surviving organization is the converting or constituent
partnership and that the person is a partner in the converting
or constituent partnership.
(c) If a person having knowledge of the conversion
or merger causes a converted or surviving organization to
incur an obligation under subsection (a) or (b), the person is
liable:
(1) to the converted or surviving organization for
any damage caused to the organization arising from the
obligation; and
(2) if another person is liable for the obligation,
to that other person for any damage caused to that other
person arising from the liability.

Article 10. Limited Liability Partnership.

partnership shall state that the partnership is formed as a
limited liability partnership, and the partnership shall
deliver to the Secretary of State for filing a statement of
limited liability partnership in accordance with subsection
(d) of this section.
(c) In order for an existing partnership to become a
limited liability partnership, the terms and conditions on
which the partnership becomes a limited liability partnership
must be approved by the affirmative approval necessary to
amend the partnership agreement and, in the case of a
partnership agreement that expressly considers obligations to
contribute to the partnership, also the affirmative approval
necessary to amend those provisions, and after such approval,
the partnership shall deliver to the Secretary of State for

limited liability partnership.
(i) The statement of limited liability partnership
is effective, and a partnership becomes a limited liability
partnership, immediately on the date the statement of limited
liability partnership is filed with the Secretary of State or

and partnership continues as a limited liability partnership
until a statement of cancellation is voluntarily filed in

limited liability partnership as a limited liability
partnership is for all purposes, except as provided in Section
10A-8-3.06, the same entity that existed before the statement
of limited liability partnership was filed and continues to be
a partnership under the laws of this state subject to the
limited liability partnership provisions of this chapter. If a
limited liability partnership dissolves and its business or
not for profit activity, or a portion of its business or not

up of partnership's business or not for profit activity, a
partnership which is a successor to the limited liability
partnership shall not be required to file a new statement of
limited liability partnership.

(6) any other information that the partners
determine to include.
(n) A statement of cancellation must executed by one
or more partners authorized to execute the statement of
cancellation.
(o) The statement of cancellation is effective, and
a partnership ceases to be a limited liability partnership,
immediately on the date the statement of cancellation is
delivered to the Secretary of State for filing or at any later
date or time specified in the statement of cancellation in
compliance with Article 4 of Chapter 1. The statement of
cancellation shall not cause the dissolution of the
partnership.

the partnership which occur or were incurred prior to the
filing of the statement of cancellation.
(q) A dissolved limited liability partnership shall
continue its status as a limited liability partnership unless
a statement of cancellation is voluntarily filed in accordance
with subsection (m).

and the statement of cancellation are filing instruments for

ยง10A-8A-10.02. Special rules for limited liability
partnerships performing professional services.
(a) A limited liability partnership shall have the
power to render professional services if it complies with the
rules of the licensing authority for such profession.
(b) Every individual who renders professional
services as a partner or as an employee of a limited liability
partnership shall be liable for any negligent or wrongful act
or omission in which the individual personally participates to
the same extent the individual would be liable if the
individual rendered the services as a sole practitioner.
(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b),
the personal liability of a partner of any limited liability
partnership engaged in providing professional services shall
be governed by Section 10A-8A-3.06.

of a foreign limited liability partnership engaged in
providing professional services shall be determined under the
law of the jurisdiction which governs the foreign limited
liability partnership.
(e) Nothing in this article shall restrict or limit
in any manner the authority or duty of a licensing authority
with respect to individuals rendering a professional service
within the jurisdiction of the licensing authority. Nothing in
this article shall restrict or limit any law, rule, or
regulation pertaining to standards of professional conduct.
(f) Nothing in this article shall limit the
authority of a licensing authority to impose requirements in
addition to those stated in this chapter on any limited
liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership
rendering professional services within the jurisdiction of the
licensing authority.
(g) A partner's transferable interest in a limited
liability partnership organized to render professional
services may be voluntarily transferred only to a qualified
person.
ยง10A-8A-10.03. Death or disqualification of partner.
(a) In the case of a limited liability partnership
performing professional services, upon the death of a partner,
upon a partner becoming a disqualified person, or upon a
transferable interest being transferred by operation of law or
court decree to a disqualified person, the transferable
interest of the deceased partner or of the disqualified person
may be transferred to a qualified person and, if not so
transferred, subject to Section 10A-8A-4.09, shall be
purchased by the limited liability partnership as provided in
this section.
(b) If the price of the transferable interest is not
fixed by the partnership agreement, the limited liability
partnership, within six months after the death or 30 days
after the disqualification or transfer, as the case may be,
shall make a written offer to pay to the holder of the
transferable interest a specified price deemed by the limited
liability partnership to be the fair value of the transferable
interest as of the date of the death, disqualification or
transfer. The offer shall be given to the personal
representative of the estate of the deceased partner, the
disqualified person, or the transferee, as the case may be,
and shall be accompanied by a balance sheet of the limited
liability partnership, as of the latest available date and not
more than 12 months prior to the making of the offer, and a
profit and loss statement of the limited liability partnership
for the 12-month period ended on the date of the balance
sheet.
(c) If within 30 days after the date of the written
offer from the limited liability partnership the fair value of
the transferable interest is agreed upon between the personal
representative of the estate of the deceased partner, the
disqualified person, or the transferee, as the case may be,
and the limited liability partnership, payment therefor shall
be made within 90 days, or such other period as the parties
may agree, after the date of the offer. Upon payment of the
agreed value, the personal representative of the estate of the
deceased partner, the disqualified person, or the transferee,
as the case may, be shall cease to have any interest in, or
claim to, the transferable interest.
(d) If within 30 days from the date of the written
offer from the limited liability partnership, the personal
representative of the estate of the deceased partner, the
disqualified person, or the transferee, as the case may be,
and the limited liability partnership do not so agree as to
the fair value of the transferable interest, then either party
may commence a civil action in the circuit court in the county
in which the limited liability partnership's principal place
of business or not for profit activity within this state is
located, and if the limited liability partnership does not
have a principal place of business or not for profit activity
within this state, then the circuit court for the county in
which the limited liability partnership's most recent
registered office is located requesting that the fair value of
the transferable interest be found and determined. The
personal representative of the estate of the deceased partner,
the disqualified person, or the transferee, as the case may
be, wherever residing, shall be made a party to the proceeding
as an action against that person's transferable interest quasi
in rem. Service shall be made in accordance with the rules of
civil procedure. The personal representative of the estate of
the deceased partner, the disqualified person, or the
transferee, as the case may be, shall be entitled to a
judgment against the limited liability partnership for the
amount of the fair value of that person's transferable
interest as of the date of death, disqualification, or
transfer. The court may, in its discretion, order that the
judgment be paid in installments and with interest and on
terms as the court may determine. The court may, if it so
elects, appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive
evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair
value. The appraisers shall have the power and authority as
shall be specified in the order of their appointment or an
amendment thereof.
(e) The judgment shall include an allowance for
interest at the rate the court finds to be fair and equitable
in all the circumstances, from the date of death,
disqualification, or transfer.
(f) The costs and expenses of any proceeding shall
be determined by the court and shall be assessed against the
parties in a manner the court deems equitable.
(g) The expenses shall include reasonable
compensation for and reasonable expenses of the appraisers and
a reasonable attorney's fee but shall exclude the fees and
expenses of counsel for and of experts employed by any party;
but:
(1) if the fair value of the transferable interest
as determined materially exceeds the amount which the limited
liability partnership offered to pay therefor, or if no offer
was made by the limited liability partnership, the court in
its discretion may award to the personal representative of the
estate of the deceased partner, the disqualified person, or
the transferee, as the case may be, the sum the court
determines to be reasonable compensation to any expert or
experts employed by the personal representative of the estate
of the deceased partner, the disqualified person, or the
transferee, as the case may be, in the proceeding; and
(2) if the offer of the limited liability
partnership for the transferable interest materially exceeds
the amount of the fair value of the transferable interest as
determined, the court in its discretion may award to the
limited liability partnership the sum the court determines to
be reasonable compensation to any expert or experts employed
by the limited liability partnership, in the proceeding.
(h) If the purchase or transfer of the transferable
interest of a deceased partner, a disqualified person or a
transferee is not completed within 12 months after the death
of the deceased partner or 12 months after the
disqualification or transfer, as the case may be, the limited
liability partnership shall forthwith cancel the transferable
interest on its books and the personal representative of the
estate of the deceased partner, the disqualified person, or
the transferee, as the case may be, shall have no further
interest in the transferable interest other than that person's
right to payment for the transferable interest under this
section.
(i) This section shall not require a limited
liability partnership to purchase a transferable interest of a
disqualified person if the disqualification is for less than
12 months from the date of disqualification. A limited
liability partnership may require the disqualified person to
sell the disqualified person's transferable interest to the
limited liability partnership upon any disqualification.
(j) Any provision of a partnership agreement
regarding the purchase or transfer of a transferable interest
of a limited liability partnership performing professional
services shall be specifically enforceable in the courts of
Alabama.
(k) Nothing in this section shall prevent or relieve
a limited liability partnership from paying pension benefits
or other deferred compensation
