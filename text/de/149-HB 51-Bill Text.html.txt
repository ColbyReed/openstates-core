        SYNOPSIS
      
      
        In 2016, the Legislature provided a reimbursement for teachers employed in Delaware who had to pay the 1-time licensure fee.  By using "teacher", we inadvertently excluded specialists including school media specialists, school counselors, school nurses, et cetera.  This Bill changes "teacher" to "educator" to include specialists and other educators.
