        Subchapter I. General Provisions
      
      
        § 
        5001.
         
        8701A. 
        Legislative findings.
      
      
        (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that the good order of the State depends upon the steady employment in useful occupations of the citizens of the State. Such steady and useful employment can be made available by encouraging the economic development of the State through the inducement of a full range of commercial, industrial, agricultural and other enterprises to locate, remain and expand in the State. Uncontrolled industrialization and expansion, however, may contribute to possible dangers to the public health and welfare through the pollution of the air, water and soil of the State. The reduction, abatement and prevention of the pollution of the State's environment and the protection of its natural resources are important concerns to be considered in the process of encouraging the economic development of the State.
      
      
        (b) The General Assembly further finds that promotion of the State as a destination for tourists and other travelers will help to enhance the State's economy and provide employment and recreational opportunities for citizens of the State.
      
      
        (c) The General Assembly further finds that promotion and assistance to small and minority-owned businesses is vital to the overall balance between large and small firms, and that it is in the State's interest to insure a strong and diversified business community.
      
      
        (d) The General Assembly further finds and declares that the creation of 
        an office for economic development with powers and duties as specified by this chapter can best accomplish the orderly development of the State while insuring that the protection and enhancement of its resources and environment will continue to be a critical concern
         a public/private partnership to attract large employers, innovative enterprises and international business opportunities while transferring duties formerly performed by the Delaware Economic Development Office to a division within the Department of State is in the best interest of the State to foster development in an increasingly competitive economy

         Human Investment and Partnership Program

        Declaration of policy.
      
      
        The General Assembly recognizes that a successful economic development effort is critical to the long term viability of our State. It further recognizes that the majority of the economic development benefits and increases in jobs will come from the businesses that are currently in the State. It is therefore crucial that the State, through its economic development program, meets the needs of those businesses in an ever changing work place. One of the critical needs for business is a well-trained and well-educated work force. As the pool of younger workers shrinks, business must turn more to women, minorities and senior citizens to fill those jobs. This labor group brings great potential for productivity, but also special needs (such as child care, elder care, flexible work times and retraining). The General Assembly, therefore, intends through this subchapter to address this situation by establishing, in the 
        Delaware Economic Development Office
         Division
        , a Human Investment and Partnership Program, whose responsibility will be to assist Delaware businesses to better utilize that work force talent. With the help of businesses who have successfully dealt with many of these issues and others in the community who have facilitated such activities, the 
        Delaware Economic Development Office
         
        Division 
        will provide that assistance to Delaware businesses.

         Legislative intent.
      
      
        The General Assembly finds that small businesses in the State are of vital significance to Delaware's economic well-being and that small businesses provide the vast majority of jobs in the State. The General Assembly also finds that small businesses have a difficult time borrowing needed funds on a conventional basis due to the high cost of these funds and the reluctance of banks to provide 100 percent financing. To help allay these obstacles, the General Assembly hereby directs the 
        Delaware Economic Development Office 
        Division 
        to use the Small Business Revolving Loan and Credit Enhancement Fund to assist small businesses in reducing the cost of loan funds by offering partial, low-cost loans or by purchasing credit enhancements for small business' sustenance and growth.

        (1) With respect to any project proposed to be financed by state-guaranteed bonds, the Authority shall find and determine, which findings and determinations shall be conclusive, in addition to making the appropriate findings and determinations required by §

        of this title, that:
      
      
        a. The aggregate principal amount of state-guaranteed bonds, the proceeds of which are used to finance the proposed project together with the aggregate principal amount of outstanding bonds used to finance any other project or projects owned, used, leased or occupied by the same assisted person, or by a related person to the assisted person, does not exceed $3,000,000;
      
      
        b. Not more than 50 percent of the cost of the proposed project shall be financed by state-guaranteed bonds, and no part of the assisted person's contribution to the cost of a proposed project may be supplied, in whole or in part, by funds appropriated by an act of the General Assembly of the State; and

Such cash reserve fund shall be pledged solely for the purposes provided in § 
        5061
         
        8761A 
        of this title and shall not be construed as a security deposit under the State's Landlord Tenant Code (Part III of Title 25).
      
      
         (f) Notwithstanding any other provision in this subchapter, the Authority shall have the power to issue bonds for the benefit of any exempt person, subject only to the following conditions:
      
      
        (2) Prior to approving an application for the issuance of such bonds, the Authority shall find and determine, which finding and determination shall be conclusive, on the basis of all information reasonably available to it, that any proposed financing for an exempt person will effectuate the purpose set forth in §

        8751A(a)(10)

         Legislative findings; authorization.
      
      
        The General Assembly finds that the growth of small businesses in the State results in increased job opportunities for Delaware residents, produces more spending in the State and increases tax bases. Existing or new small businesses and recently displaced Delaware employees beginning new businesses can provide significant economic benefits to the State provided they can obtain sufficient equity financing to carry them from start-up through the initial development phases of a business. In order to encourage the increased availability of risk equity capital to these enterprises, the 
        Delaware Economic Development Office through the
         Delaware Economic Development Authority is authorized to establish criteria for, and issue, certifications of eligibility for investors qualifying for the Investment Tax Credit Program.

        5097 and 5098
         
        8797A and 8798A 
        of this title and may issue rules or regulations relating to such other matters as, in the judgment of the Authority, are necessary or desirable to further the purposes of the Program, not inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter. Rules or regulations issued under this subchapter shall have the force and effect of law.

        c. Such application shall be made in such form and at such time as the Authority may by regulation prescribe;

        8799A.
         Revocation of qualification or certification.

        SYNOPSIS
      
      
        Recognizing a fundamental economic change toward businesses that require innovation, The Honorable John C. Carney, Governor of the State of Delaware, issued Executive Order One on January 18, 2017 creating a Working Group of business and government leaders to study methods to improve coordination between the public and private sectors, attract growing businesses and foster economic development throughout the State. The Governor appointed members of the Working Group representing government, business leaders and the community. 
      
      
        The Working Group conducted public meetings in the State to receive input from the public on issues related to business development and retention in the changing economy. The Working Group considered research and input from experts in the area of public/private partnerships as well as statutes and data from other states. The Working Group issued a report to the Governor on April 7, 2017 recommending the establishment of a public/private partnership in Delaware to focus on investment attraction, entrepreneurship and innovation, talent development and retention, and research and analysis.
      
      
        Upon consideration of the Working Group report, the General Assembly intends to appropriate funding for the Public/Private Partnership, a nonprofit public/private partnership comprised of leaders in the public, business and the community to build a stronger entrepreneurial environment in the State.  The Public/Private Partnership will focus on leveraging private resources to improve business recruitment, retention and expansion, identify and develop a talented workforce, connecting with the global economy and building a stronger entrepreneurial environment. To ensure public accountability the Partnership will submit to the Governor and the General Assembly tax returns, financial statements, organizational polices and will make available for inspection meeting minutes.
      
      
        To make the most efficient use of available resources, this legislation eliminates the Delaware Economic Development Office because the public/private partnership will be conducting business attraction and development functions formerly performed by that Office. This legislation transfers tourism, the Delaware Motion Picture and Television Commission and duties related to administration and the financial analysis of proposed economic development projects to the Department of State. The transfer will improve efficiency, eliminate redundancy and foster business attraction, innovation, tourism, small business development, business retention, minority, women, disadvantaged and veteran owned businesses.
      
      
        Sections 3 through 21 of this Act simply make conforming changes throughout Title 29 and other titles of the Delaware Code where references to the Delaware Economic Development Office appear. The Division of Small Business, Development and Tourism is referenced in its place. The bill also removes some Code Sections that reference funds and functions that no longer exist.
