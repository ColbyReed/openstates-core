to any other ground the court may declare the regulation invalid                                                  
(1)  for a substantial failure to comply with AS 44.62.010 - 44.62.319

ground that the facts recited in the statement do not constitute an emergency under

(a)  In AS 44.62.010 - 44.62.319 [AS 44.62.010 - 44.62.320], unless the                                             
context otherwise requires,                                                                                       
(1)  "lieutenant governor" means the office of the lieutenant governor in                                               
the executive branch of the state government, or another agency designated by                                           
executive order under the constitution;                                                                           
(2)  "order of repeal" means a resolution, order, or other official act of a                                            
state agency that expressly repeals a regulation in whole or in part;                                             
(3)  "regulation" means every rule, regulation, order, or standard of                                                   
general application or the amendment, supplement, or revision of a rule, regulation,                                    
order, or standard adopted by a state agency to implement, interpret, or make specific                                  
the law enforced or administered by it, or to govern its procedure, except one that                                     
relates only to the internal management of a state agency; "regulation" does not                                        
include a form prescribed by a state agency or instructions relating to the use of the                                  
form, but this provision is not a limitation upon a requirement that a regulation be                                    
adopted under this chapter when one is needed to implement the law under which the                                      
form is issued; "regulation" includes "manuals," "policies," "instructions," "guides to                                 
enforcement," "interpretative bulletins," "interpretations," and the like, that have the                                
effect of rules, orders, regulations, or standards of general application, and this and                                 
similar phraseology may not be used to avoid or circumvent this chapter; whether a                                      
regulation, regardless of name, is covered by this chapter depends in part on whether it                                
affects the public or is used by the agency in dealing with the public;                                           
(4)  "state agency" means a department, office, agency, or other                                                        
organizational unit of the executive branch, except one expressly excluded by law, but                                  
does not include an agency in the judicial or legislative branches of the state                                         
government.                                                                                                       
* Sec. 18. AS 44.62.710(a) is amended to read:                                                                     
(a)  The purpose of AS 44.62.710 - 44.62.800 is to establish a framework for                                            
the conduct of negotiated regulation making consistent with AS 44.62.010 - 44.62.319                                
[AS 44.62.010 - 44.62.320]. Negotiated regulation making is not a substitute for the                                    
requirements of AS 44.62.010 - 44.62.319 [AS 44.62.010 - 44.62.320] but may be                                      
used as a supplemental procedure to permit the direct participation of affected interests                               
in the development of new regulations or the amendment or repeal of existing                                            
regulations. A consensus agreement reached by a negotiated regulation making                                            
committee may be modified by an agency head as a result of the subsequent regulation                                    
making process. AS 44.62.710 - 44.62.800 may not be construed as an attempt to limit                                    
innovation and experimentation with the negotiated regulation making process or to                                
limit other means to obtain public participation in the regulation making process.                                
* Sec. 19. AS 44.62.720(a) is amended to read:                                                                     
(a)  In addition to the regulation adoption requirements under AS 44.62.010 -                                       
44.62.319 [AS 44.62.010 - 44.62.320], an agency head may determine that the use of a                                
negotiated regulation making committee to negotiate and develop a proposed                                              
regulation is in the public interest. In making that determination, the agency head is                                  
advised to consider whether                                                                                       
(1)  there is a need for a regulation, including whether any legal action                               
is pending that might resolve the need;                                                                           
(2)  there are a limited number of identifiable interests that are held by                                              
more than one person and that will be significantly affected by the regulation;                                   
(3)  there is a reasonable likelihood that a committee can be convened                                                  
with a balanced representation of persons who                                                                     
(A)  can adequately represent the interests identified under (2)                                                        
of this section; and                                                                                         
(B)  are willing to negotiate in good faith to reach a consensus                                                        
on the proposed regulation;                                                                                  
(4)  there is a reasonable likelihood that a committee will reach a                                                     
consensus on the proposed regulation within a fixed period of time;                                               
(5)  the negotiated regulation making procedure will not unreasonably
