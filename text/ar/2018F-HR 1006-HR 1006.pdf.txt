*BPG640*                                                     02/12/2018 9:15:50 AM BPG640
                                                                               HR1006




BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:


      SECTION 1.   The introductory language of § 5-73-306, concerning the
places a person who possesses a license to carry a concealed handgun is
prohibited from carrying a concealed handgun, is amended to read as follows:
      Except as permitted under § 5-73-322(g), a license to carry a concealed
handgun issued under this subchapter does not authorize a person to carry a
concealed handgun into:


      SECTION 2.   Arkansas Code § 5-73-322(g)(2)(A), concerning the training
requirements for a concealed carry endorsement, is amended to read as
follows:
           (2)(A)   Training required under this subsection shall:
                          (i)    Not be required to be renewed;
                          (ii)    Consist of a course of up to eight (8) hours;
and
                          (iii)   Be offered by all training instructors and at
all concealed carry training courses; and
                          (iv) (iii)   Cost no more than a nominal reasonable
amount.


      SECTION 3.   EMERGENCY CLAUSE.       It is found and determined by the
General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the current introductory
language of Arkansas Code § 5-73-306 lacks clarity and that the current
requirement under Arkansas Code § 5-73-322(g)(2)(A) that training for a
concealed carry endorsement be offered by all training instructors and at all
concealed carry training courses is overly burdensome; that a concealed carry
training instructor should be able to determine whether he or she desires to
offer training for a concealed carry endorsement; and that this act is
immediately necessary because the current requirement has limited the number
of instructors who are willing to offer concealed carry training.        Therefore,
an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary
for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become
effective on:

                                       2               02/12/2018 9:15:50 AM BPG640
                                                                         HR1006


           (1)   The date of its approval by the Governor;
           (2)   If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
bill; or
           (3)   If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto."
