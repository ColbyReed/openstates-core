necessary monies for the Department of Education to continue such services;
and that a delay in the effective date of this Act could work irreparable
harm upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act

and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after the date of its
passage and approval.
