               AN ACT TO ALLOW MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO

                                              Subtitle
                        TO ALLOW MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
                        TO ATTEND HEARINGS HELD UNDER THE
                        ARKANSAS JUVENILE CODE OF 1989.




BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:


       SECTION 1.        DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative intent.
       The General Assembly recognizes:
               (1)      That it is the duty of the General Assembly to initiate
intelligent legislative reform that benefits the citizens of Arkansas;
               (2)      That many families in Arkansas are involved in child welfare
cases with the Department of Human Services;
               (3)      That these families sometimes turn to members of the General
Assembly for assistance when their families are negatively affected by
certain limitations in the child welfare process;
               (4)      That it is important to preserve a family unit when
possible;
               (5)      That the General Assembly's ability to initiate legislative
reform with regard to child welfare is impeded by the nontransparent nature
of child welfare proceedings, closed juvenile hearings, and other protections
that prevent the General Assembly from adequately observing and reviewing the
child welfare process; and

                                                                             SB7


           (6)     That in order to intelligently initiate reform, the General
Assembly requires an expansion of its ability to observe and review all
aspects of the child welfare process.


     SECTION 2.     Arkansas Code Title 9, Chapter 27, Subchapter 3, is amended
to add an additional section to read as follows:
     9-27-371.     Hearings — Attendance by member of General Assembly.
     Regardless of any other provision to the contrary under this
subchapter, a member of the General Assembly may attend any hearing,
including a closed hearing, held under the Arkansas Juvenile Code of 1989, §
9-27-301 et seq.
