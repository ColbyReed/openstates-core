the Department of Finance and Administration, as authorized by law, shall be

     SECTION 3. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.     It is the intent of the General

manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.


     SECTION 4. EMERGENCY CLAUSE.   It is found and determined by the General
Assembly, that funds provided by the General Assembly for the operations of
the Arkansas State University - Beebe are, due to unforeseen circumstances,
insufficient for the Arkansas State University - Beebe to continue to provide
essential governmental services; that the provisions of this act will provide
the necessary monies for the Arkansas State University - Beebe to continue
such services; and that a delay in the effective date of this Act could work
irreparable harm upon the proper administration and provision of essential
governmental programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist
and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public
peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after the
date of its passage and approval.
     If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall
become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the
Governor may veto the bill.   If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the
veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house
overrides the veto.
