For An Act To Be Entitled
AN ACT TO MAKE TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO ARKANSAS
CONSTITUTION, ARTICLE 19, § 30, TO INTEGRATE AND
INCORPORATE THE PROVISIONS OF ACTS 2017, NOS. 207,
312, AND 1108 INTO ARKANSAS CONSTITUTION, ARTICLE 19,
§ 30; TO DECLARE AN EMERGENCY; AND FOR OTHER

Subtitle
TO INTEGRATE AND INCORPORATE THE
PROVISIONS OF ACTS 2017, NOS. 207, 312,
AND 1108 INTO ARKANSAS CONSTITUTION,
ARTICLE 19, § 30; AND TO DECLARE AN
EMERGENCY.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:
SECTION 1.        LEGISLATIVE INTENT.        (a)   The General Assembly finds that:
(1)    Arkansas Constitution, Article 19, § 30(d) empowers the
General Assembly to amend Arkansas Constitution, Article 19, § 30, so long as
the amendments are germane to the section and consistent with its policy and
purposes;
(2)    Three (3) separate acts of the regular session of the
Ninety-First General Assembly, Acts 2017, Nos. 207, 312, and 1108, amended
Arkansas Constitution, Article 19, § 30;
(3)    All of these acts were enacted independently of the others,
and the acts do not reflect the language added by the other amendatory acts;
(4)    Arkansas Code § 1-2-207, which addresses codification upon
the passage of multiple acts amending the same subject matter, only
references amendments to the Arkansas Code and uncodified acts and does not
address the treatment of acts amending the Arkansas Constitution;
(5)    The applicability of Arkansas Code § 1-2-303(d)(1),
concerning nonsubstantive technical corrections to provisions of the Arkansas
Code and acts of the General Assembly made under the direction of the
Arkansas Code Revision Commission, is equally uncertain;
(6)    It is unclear whether the Arkansas Code Revision Commission
may exercise its authority under Arkansas Code §§ 1-2-207 and 1-2-303 and
make the customary technical corrections, such as changes to numbering and
formatting, that are made by the Arkansas Code Revision Commission to acts of
the General Assembly that amend the same section of law; and
(7)    Without technical corrections to the conflicting language,
Arkansas Constitution, Article 19, § 30, will not read coherently and will be
difficult to interpret, utilize, and cite.
(b)   The intent of this act is to:
(1)    Supersede certain provisions of Acts 2017, Nos. 207, 312,
and 1108 that conflict with or substantively duplicate the provisions of this
act; and
(2)    Enact certain provisions of Acts 2017, Nos. 207, 312, and
1108 in a format that integrates and incorporates certain provisions of the
three (3) acts by restating certain provisions in a coherent, cohesive, and
comprehensive manner.
(c)   This act does not modify or supersede:
(1)    Any emergency clause or effective date clause of Acts 2017,
Nos. 207, 312, and 1108; or
(2)    Sections within Acts 2017, Nos. 207, 312, and 1108 that are
not within this act.
SECTION 2.     Under the authority granted by Arkansas Constitution
Article 19, Section 30(d), Arkansas Constitution, Article 19, Section 30(b),
