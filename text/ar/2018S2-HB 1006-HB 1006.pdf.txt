BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:


SECTION 1.     As authorized by Article 2, ยง 7, of the Arkansas Constitution,
Arkansas Code Title 16, Chapter 30, is amended to add an additional section
to read as follows:
       16-30-104.       Contractual waiver of jury trial.
       (a)    A written provision in a contract in which the parties agree to
waive their respective rights to trial by jury under Arkansas Constitution,
Article 2, ยง 7, is presumptively valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.
       (b)    A party that has signed a contract containing a waiver described
in subsection (a) of this section may not avoid enforcement or application of
the waiver by asserting that the party did not read, understand, or agree to

subsection (a) of this section that attempts to enforce the contract or any

                                                                               HB1006


rights under the contract as a third-party beneficiary or through another
legal theory permitting the enforcement of the contract is subject to the
waiver in the same manner as the parties to the contract.
      (d)   A waiver described in subsection (a) of this section is valid and
enforceable whether the parties entered into the contract before or after a
lawsuit concerning the contract was filed.


      SECTION 2.   DO NOT CODIFY.   Retroactivity.
      (a)   This act applies retroactively to a contract to waive a jury trial
entered into before the effective date of this act.
      (b)   This act applies retroactively to all judicial proceedings in
which a contract to waive a jury trial is at issue if the judicial proceeding
is still pending on the effective date of the act.


      SECTION 3.   EMERGENCY CLAUSE.       It is found and determined by the
General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that decisions of the Arkansas
Supreme Court regarding contractual jury waiver provisions leave parties in
doubt about the applicability of their contracts; that this uncertainty must
be resolved immediately; and that this uncertainty may only be resolved
through the immediate effectiveness of this act.        Therefore, an emergency is
declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective
on:
             (1)   The date of its approval by the Governor;
             (2)   If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
bill; or
             (3)   If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.




                                       2               03/12/2018 4:56:56 PM BPG660
