BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:


       SECTION 1.       As authorized by Article 2, ยง 7, of the Arkansas
Constitution, Arkansas Code Title 16, Chapter 30, is amended to add an
additional section to read as follows:
       16-30-104.       Contractual waiver of jury trial.
       A written provision in a contract to borrow money or to lend money in
which the parties agree to waive their respective rights to a trial by jury
under Arkansas Constitution, Article 2, ยง 7, is valid and enforceable except
upon those grounds that exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any
contract


       SECTION 2.       DO NOT CODIFY.       Retroactivity.
       (a)    This act applies retroactively to a contract to waive a jury trial
entered into before the effective date of this act.



*BPG653*                                                                    03-13-2018 12:30:31 BPG653
As Engrossed:     S3/13/18                                                       SB5


      (b)   This act applies retroactively to all judicial proceedings in
which a contract to waive a jury trial is at issue if the judicial proceeding
is still pending on the effective date of the act.


      SECTION 3.    EMERGENCY CLAUSE.       It is found and determined by the
General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that decisions of the Arkansas
Supreme Court regarding contractual jury waiver provisions leave parties in
doubt about the applicability of their contracts; that this uncertainty must
be resolved immediately; and that this uncertainty may only be resolved
through the immediate effectiveness of this act.         Therefore, an emergency is
declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective
on:
            (1)    The date of its approval by the Governor;
            (2)    If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
bill; or
            (3)    If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
