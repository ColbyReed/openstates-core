     SECTION 2. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS.     Disbursement of funds
authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency

the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary

     SECTION 3. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.     It is the intent of the General

the necessary monies for the East Arkansas Community College to continue such
services; and that a delay in the effective date of this Act could work
irreparable harm upon the proper administration and provision of essential
governmental programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist
and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public
peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after the
date of its passage and approval.
