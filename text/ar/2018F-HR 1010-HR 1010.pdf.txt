BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:


       SECTION 1.       Arkansas Code § 20-77-1905(a), concerning the exemptions
under the assessment fee on hospitals, is amended to read as follows:
       (a)    The following hospitals shall be exempt from the assessment



*JMB575*                                                       02/12/2018 2:25:51 PM JMB575
                                                                              HR1010


imposed under § 20-77-1902 unless the exemption is adjudged to be
unconstitutional or otherwise determined to be invalid:
            (1)(A)   Hospitals that are not privately operated hospitals.
                  (B)   Subdivision (a)(1)(A) of this section does not include
border city university affiliated pediatric teaching hospitals;
            (2)   Hospitals licensed by the Department of Health as
rehabilitation hospitals; and
            (3)   Specialty hospitals.


     SECTION 2.   Arkansas Code § 20-77-1907(e), concerning the notice of
assessment relating to the assessment fee on hospitals, is amended to read as
follows:
     (e)   A hospital subject to an assessment under this subchapter that has
not been previously licensed as a hospital in Arkansas and that commences
hospital operations during a state fiscal year, or a hospital that otherwise
becomes subject to the assessment, shall pay the required assessment computed
under § 20-77-1902 and shall be eligible for hospital access payments under §
20-77-1908 on the date specified in rules promulgated by the division under

     SECTION 3.   EMERGENCY CLAUSE.       It is found and determined by the
General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the safety and health of the
children of Arkansas need additional protections; that changes in the law
will allow the state to impose a hospital assessment on additional hospitals
that provide pediatric care for children; that without the assessment, a
pediatric hospital will no longer be available to meet the needs of children
in the state; and that this act is immediately necessary to ensure
substantial funding in the upcoming fiscal year and to ensure continuing
health care for all children of Arkansas. Therefore, an emergency is declared
to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of
the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on:
            (1)   The date of its approval by the Governor;
            (2)   If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
bill; or
            (3)   If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is

overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto."
