covered by state Medicaid programs in the previous year; and


     WHEREAS, the federal regulations require that the 1095-B forms are sent
to the individual's last known permanent mailing address or temporary mailing
address if no permanent mailing address is shown unless the entity furnishing
the statement meets all requirements to provide the 1095-B forms
electronically; and

spent a total of two million seven hundred sixty-three thousand one hundred
eight-six dollars and forty-eight cents ($2,763,186.48) in the 2017 calendar
year to process and mail the required tax year 2016 1095-B forms to
recipients; and


     WHEREAS, many of these 1095-B forms were returned to the Department of
Human Services within the State of Arkansas because the Medicaid recipients
did not provide the department with the proper or accurate address; and


     WHEREAS, unless the requirement to mail 1095-B forms is rescinded in
its entirety, states should have the option to either make the 1095-B forms
available online exclusively without requiring individual consent or mail the
1095-B forms only once per year and make the forms, if returned, available
online thereafter; and


     WHEREAS, states across the nation are spending large amounts of funds
to comply with federal law despite the repeal of the tax penalty for failure
to maintain minimum essential health insurance coverage,
