       SECTION 9. SPECIAL LANGUAGE.   NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.    CARRY
FORWARD.   At the close of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 2019, any
unexpended balance of monies provided from the State Library Fund Account for
Books and Subscriptions, as provided in the State Operations Appropriation of
this Act, shall be transferred forward and made available for the same
purpose for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 2019.
   Any carry forward of unexpended balance of funding as authorized herein,
may be carried forward under the following conditions:
   (1)     Prior to June 30, 2018 2019 the Agency shall by written statement
set forth its reason(s) for the need to carry forward said funding to the
Department of Finance and Administration Office of Budget;
   (2)     The Department of Finance and Administration Office of Budget shall
report to the Arkansas Legislative Council all amounts carried forward by the
September Arkansas Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee meeting
which report shall include the name of the Agency, Board, Commission or
Institution and the amount of the funding carried forward, the program name
or line item, the funding source of that appropriation and a copy of the
written request set forth in (1) above;
   (3)     Each Agency, Board, Commission or Institution shall provide a
written report to the Arkansas Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee
containing all information set forth in item (2) above, along with a written
statement as to the current status of the project, contract, purpose etc. for
which the carry forward was originally requested no later than thirty (30)
days prior to the time the Agency, Board, Commission or Institution presents

                                      5            01/29/2018 2:37:38 PM KMW012
                                                                              HB1038


its budget request to the Arkansas Legislative Council/Joint Budget
Committee; and
    (4)   Thereupon, the Department of Finance and Administration shall
include all information obtained in item (3) above in the budget manuals
and/or a statement of non-compliance by the Agency, Board, Commission or
Institution.
   The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2017
2018 through June 30, 2018 2019.


      SECTION 10. SPECIAL LANGUAGE.       NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.      TRANSFER
OF FUNDS - PROMOTIONAL ITEMS. The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall
establish upon request from the Arkansas Department of Education - Arkansas
State Library a special appropriation line item to be used in the acquisition
of promotional items.    When the Department of Education - Arkansas State
Library wishes to transfer monies from its operating expenses to promotional
items, the request shall be forwarded to the Chief Fiscal Officer of the
State for processing after prior approval by the Arkansas Legislative Council
or Joint Budget Committee.   Determining the maximum number of employees and
the maximum amount of appropriation and general revenue funding for a state
agency each fiscal year is the prerogative of the General Assembly.      This is
usually accomplished by delineating such maximums in the appropriation act(s)
for a state agency and the general revenue allocations authorized for each
fund and fund account by amendment to the Revenue Stabilization Law.
Further, the General Assembly has determined that the Department of Education
- Arkansas State Library may operate more efficiently if some flexibility is
provided to the Department of Education - Arkansas State Library authorizing
broad powers under this Section.    Therefore, it is both necessary and
appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior
approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee as provided by
this Section.    The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or
Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this Section.      If the
requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee
is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire
section is void.
   The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2017

                                      6               01/29/2018 2:37:38 PM KMW012

2018 through June 30, 2018 2019.


        SECTION 11. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS.   Disbursement of funds
authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal
control laws of this State, where applicable, and regulations promulgated by
the Department of Finance and Administration, as authorized by law, shall be
strictly complied with in disbursement of said funds.


        SECTION 12. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.   It is the intent of the General
Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
