438, 479, 593, 639, 641, 670, 740, 948, 1023, 1024,
1098, AND 1100 OF 2017 INTO ARKANSAS CONSTITUTION,

Subtitle
TO INTEGRATE AND INCORPORATE THE
PROVISIONS OF ACTS OF 2017 INTO ARKANSAS
CONSTITUTION, AMENDMENT 98, ALSO KNOWN AS
THE "ARKANSAS MEDICAL MARIJUANA AMENDMENT
OF 2016"; AND TO DECLARE AN EMERGENCY.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:
SECTION 1.        DO NOT CODIFY.      LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
(a)    The General Assembly finds that:
(1)    Arkansas Constitution, Amendment 98, § 23, empowers the
General Assembly to amend certain sections of Arkansas Constitution,
Amendment 98, so long as the amendments are germane to the section and
consistent with its policy and purposes;
(2)    Twenty-three (23) separate acts of the regular session of
the Ninety-First General Assembly, Acts 2017, Nos. 4, 5, 438, 479, 544, 545,
587, 593, 594, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 670, 740, 948, 1022, 1023, 1024,
1098, 1099, and 1100, amended Arkansas Constitution, Amendment 98;
(3)(A)     Twenty (20) of these twenty-three (23) acts were enacted
independently of the other acts and do not reflect the language added by any
of the other amendatory acts.
(B)   However:
(i)     Acts 2017, No. 438, § 1, was enacted as amended
by Acts 2017, No. 5;
(ii)    Acts 2017, No. 593, § 1, was enacted as amended
by Acts 2017, No. 5; and
(iii)    Acts 2017, No. 640, § 1, was enacted as
amended by Acts 2017, No. 4;
(4)   Thirteen (13) of the twenty-three (23) acts, Acts 2017, Nos.
4, 438, 479, 593, 639, 641, 670, 740, 948, 1023, 1024, 1098, and 1100, have
conflicting provisions such as the same numbering for new subsections or
subdivisions within the same section or subsection;
(5)(A)     Acts 2017, No. 1023, §§ 2 and 3, imposed additional
requirements on both the Department of Health and the Alcoholic Beverage
Control Division of the Department of Finance and Administration regarding
labeling and testing of usable marijuana to ensure that food or drink that
has been combined with usable marijuana does not exceed ten milligrams (10
mg) of active tetrahydrocannabinol per portion.
(B)   However, after further review, the additional
requirements imposed on the Department of Health within Acts 2017, No. 1023,
§ 2, are unnecessary to achieve this purpose as the Alcoholic Beverage
Control Division of the Department of Finance and Administration must also
meet these requirements for dispensaries and cultivation facilities;
(6)   Arkansas Code § 1-2-207, which addresses codification upon
the passage of multiple acts amending the same subject matter, only
references amendments to the Arkansas Code and uncodified acts and does not
address the treatment of acts amending the Arkansas Constitution;
(7)   The applicability of Arkansas Code § 1-2-303(d)(1),
concerning nonsubstantive technical corrections to provisions of the Arkansas
Code and acts of the General Assembly made under the direction of the
Arkansas Code Revision Commission, is equally uncertain;
(8)   It is unclear whether the Arkansas Code Revision Commission
05-01-2017 08:56:35 JMB524
may exercise its authority under Arkansas Code §§ 1-2-207 and 1-2-303 and
make the customary technical corrections, such as changes to numbering and
formatting, that are made by the Arkansas Code Revision Commission to acts of
the General Assembly that amend the same section of law; and
(9)   Without technical corrections to the conflicting language in
thirteen (13) of the twenty-three (23) amendatory acts of the 2017 regular
session, Arkansas Constitution, Amendment 98, will not read coherently and
will be difficult to interpret, utilize, and cite.
(b)    The intent of this act is to:
(1)   Supersede certain provisions of Acts 2017, Nos. 4, 438, 479,
593, 639, 641, 670, 740, 948, 1023, 1024, 1098, and 1100, that conflict with
or substantively duplicate the provisions of this act;
(2)   Repeal Acts 2017, No. 1023, § 2, to ensure that the language
incorporated within Arkansas Constitution, Amendment 98, is without
conflicts; and
(3)   Enact certain provisions of Acts 2017, Nos. 4, 438, 479,
593, 639, 641, 670, 740, 948, 1023, 1024, 1098, and 1100, in a format that
integrates and incorporates certain provisions of the thirteen (13) acts by
restating certain provisions in a coherent, cohesive, and comprehensive
manner.
(c)    This act does not modify or supersede:
(1)   Any emergency clause, effective date clause, or
retroactivity clause, of Acts 2017, Nos. 4, 438, 479, 593, 639, 641, 670,
740, 948, 1023, 1024, 1098, and 1100;
(2)   Sections within Acts 2017, Nos. 4, 438, 479, 593, 639, 641,
670, 740, 948, 1023, 1024, 1098, and 1100, that are not within this act; or
(3)   Acts 2017, Nos. 5, 544, 545, 587, 594, 638, 640, 642, 1022,
and 1099.

Constitution, Amendment 98, also known as the "Arkansas Medical Marijuana
