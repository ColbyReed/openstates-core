Amends the School Code. In provisions allowing a board of education to 
enter into a contract with a third party for
non-instructional services 
currently performed by any employee or bargaining
unit member, removes a 
provision that requires any third party that submits a bid to perform the 
non-instructional services to provide a benefits package for the third 
party's employees who will perform the non-instructional services 
comparable to the benefits package provided to school board employees who 
perform those services.

Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois,
 
represented in the General Assembly:

  







 
    
Section 5. 
The School Code is amended  by changing Section 
10-22.34c as follows:

educational support personnel employees
upon 90 days
written 
notice to
the affected employees, provided that:
    
    
(1)  a contract must not be entered into and become 
effective during the term of a collective bargaining 
agreement, as that term is set forth in the agreement, 
covering any employees who perform the non-instructional 
services;
    
    
(2)  a contract may only take effect upon the expiration 
of an existing collective bargaining agreement;
    
    
(3)  any third party that submits a bid to perform the 
non-instructional services shall provide the following:

    
    
    
(A)  evidence of liability insurance in scope and 
amount equivalent to the liability insurance provided 
by the school board pursuant to Section 10-22.3 of this 
Code;

package provided to school board employees who perform 
those services;
    
    
    
(C)  a list of the number of employees who will 
provide the non-instructional services, the job 
classifications of those employees, and the wages the 
third party will pay those employees;
    
    
    
(D)  a minimum 3-year cost projection, using 
generally accepted accounting principles and which the 
third party is prohibited from increasing if the bid is 
accepted by the school board, for each and every 
expenditure category and account for performing the 
non-instructional services;
    
    
    
(E) composite  information about the criminal and

employees need not be provided with the submission of 
the bid, but must be made available upon request of the 
school board; and

    
    
    
(F)  an affidavit, notarized by the president or 
chief executive officer of the third party, that each 
of its employees has completed a criminal background 
check as required by Section 10-21.9 of this Code 
within 3 months prior to submission of the bid, 
provided that the results of such background checks 
need not be provided with the submission of the bid, 
but must be made available upon request of the school 
board;

    
    
(4)  a contract must not be entered into unless the 
school board provides a cost comparison, using generally 
accepted accounting principles, of each and every 
expenditure category and account that the school board 
projects it would incur over the term of the contract if it 
continued to perform the non-instructional services using 
its own employees with each and every expenditure category 
and account that is projected a third party would incur if 
a third party performed the non-instructional services;
    
    
(5)  review and consideration of all bids by third 
parties to perform the non-instructional services shall 
take place in open session of a regularly scheduled school 
board meeting, unless the exclusive bargaining 
representative of the employees who perform the 
non-instructional services, if any such exclusive 
bargaining representative exists, agrees in writing that 
such review and consideration can take place in open 
session at a specially scheduled school board meeting;
    
    
(6)  a minimum of one public hearing, conducted by the 
school board prior to a regularly scheduled school board 
meeting, to discuss the school board's proposal to contract 
with a third party to perform the non-instructional 
services must be held before the school board may enter 
into such a contract; the school board must provide  notice 
to the public of the date, time, and location of the first 
public hearing on or before the initial date that bids to 
provide the non-instructional services are solicited or a 
minimum of 30 days prior to entering into such a contract, 
whichever provides a greater period of notice;
    
    
(7)  a contract shall contain provisions requiring the 
contractor to offer available employee positions pursuant 
to the contract to qualified school district employees 
whose employment is terminated because of the contract; and
    
    
(8)  a contract shall contain provisions requiring the 
contractor to comply with a policy of nondiscrimination and 
equal employment opportunity for all persons and to take 
affirmative steps to provide equal opportunity for all 
persons.


    
(b)  Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this Section, a board 
of education may enter into a contract, of no longer than 3 
months in duration, with a third party for non-instructional 
services currently performed by an employee or bargaining unit 
member for the purpose of augmenting the current workforce in 
an emergency situation that threatens the safety or health of 
the school district's students or staff, provided that the 
school board meets all of its obligations under the Illinois 
Educational Labor Relations Act.

    
(c)  The changes to this Section made by this amendatory Act 
of the 95th General Assembly are not applicable to 
non-instructional services of a school district that on the 
effective date of this amendatory Act of the 95th General 
Assembly are performed for the school district by a third 
party.
