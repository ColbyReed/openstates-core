Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois,
 
represented in the General Assembly:

  

 
    
Section 5. 
The Public Building Commission Act is amended  by 
changing Sections 2.5, 3, 20, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.10, 20.15,

(Section scheduled to be repealed on June 1, 2018)
    
Sec. 2.5. 
Legislative policy; conditions for use of 
design-build. 
It is the intent of the General Assembly that a 
commission be allowed to use the design-build delivery method 
for public projects if

it is shown to be in the commission's 
best interest for that particular project.
    
It shall be the policy of the commission in the procurement 
of design-build services to publicly announce all requirements 
for design-build services and to procure these services on the 
basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications and with 
due regard for the principles of competitive selection.
    
The commission shall, prior to issuing requests for 
proposals, promulgate and publish procedures for the 
solicitation and award of contracts pursuant to this Act.
    
The commission shall, for each public project or projects 
permitted under this Act, make a written determination, 
including a description as to the particular

advantages of the 
design-build procurement method, that it is in the best 
interests of the commission to enter into a design-build 
contract for the project or projects.
    
In making that determination, the following factors shall 
be considered:
    
    
(1) The probability that the design-build procurement 
method will be in the best interests of the commission by 
providing a material savings of time or cost over the 
design-bid-build or other delivery system.
    
    
(2) The type and size of the project and its 
suitability to the design-build procurement method.
    
    
(3) The ability of the design-build entity to define 
and provide comprehensive scope and performance criteria 
for the project.
    
The commission shall require the design-build entity to 
comply with the utilization goals established by the corporate 
authorities of the commission for minority and women business 
enterprises and to comply with Section 2-105 of the Illinois 
Human Rights Act.
    
This Section is repealed on June 1, 
2023
 
2018
; provided 
that any design-build contracts entered into before such date 
or any procurement of a project under this Act commenced before 
such date, and the contracts resulting from those procurements, 
shall remain effective.

Sec. 20. 
Contracts let to lowest responsible bidder; 
competitive bidding; advertisement for bids; design-build 
contracts.
    
(a) All contracts to be let for the construction, 
alteration,
improvement, repair, enlargement, demolition or 
removal of any buildings or
other facilities, or for materials 
or supplies to be furnished, where the
amount thereof is in 
excess of $20,000, shall be awarded as a design-build contract 
in accordance with Sections 20.3 through 20.20 or shall be let 
to the lowest
responsible bidder, or bidders, on open 
competitive bidding.
    
(b) A contract awarded on the basis of competitive bidding 
shall be awarded after public
advertisement published at least 
once in each week for three consecutive
weeks prior to the 
opening of bids, in a daily newspaper of general
circulation in 
the county where the commission is located, except in the case 
of an emergency situation, as determined by the chief executive 
officer. If a contract is awarded in an emergency situation, 
(i) the contract accepted must be based on the lowest 
responsible proposal after the commission has made a diligent 
effort to solicit multiple proposals by telephone, facsimile, 
or other efficient means and (ii) the chief executive officer 
must submit a report at the next regular meeting of the Board, 
to be ratified by the Board and entered into the official 
record, that states the chief executive officer's reason for 
declaring an emergency situation, the names of all parties 
solicited for proposals, and their proposals and that includes 
a copy of the contract awarded. Nothing
contained in this 
Section shall be construed to prohibit the Board of

Commissioners from placing additional advertisements in 
recognized trade
journals. Advertisements for bids shall 
describe the character of the
proposed contract in sufficient 
detail to enable the bidders thereon to
know what their 
obligation will be, either in the advertisement itself, or
by 
reference to detailed plans and specifications on file in the 
office of
the Public Building Commission at the time of the 
publication of the first
announcement. Such advertisement 
shall also state the date, time, and place
assigned for the 
opening of bids. No bids shall be received at any time

subsequent to the time indicated in said advertisement.
    
(c) In addition to the requirements of Section 20.3, the 
Commission shall advertise a design-build solicitation at 
least once in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the 
county where the Commission is located.  The date that Phase I 
submissions by design-build entities are due must be at least 
14 calendar days after the date the newspaper advertisement for 
design-build proposals is first published.  The advertisement 
shall identify the design-build project, the due date, the 
place and time for Phase I submissions, and the place where 
proposers can obtain a complete copy of the request for 
design-build proposals, including the criteria for evaluation 
and the scope and performance criteria.  The Commission is not 
precluded from using other media or from placing advertisements 
in addition to the one required under this subsection.
    
(d) The Board of
Commissioners may reject any and all bids 
and proposals received and may readvertise for
bids or issue a 
new request for design-build proposals.
    
(e) All bids shall be open to public inspection in the 
office of the
Public Building Commission after an award or 
final selection has been made. The successful bidder for such 
work shall enter into
contracts furnished and prescribed by the 
Board of Commissioners and in
addition to any other bonds 
required under this Act the successful bidder
shall execute and 
give bond, payable to and to be approved by the
Commission, 
with a corporate surety authorized to do business under the

laws of the State of Illinois, in an amount to be determined by 
the Board
of Commissioners, conditioned upon the payment of all 
labor furnished and
materials supplied in the prosecution of 
the contracted work. If the bidder
whose bid has been accepted 
shall neglect or refuse to accept the contract
within five (5) 
days after written notice that the same has been awarded to

him, or if he accepts but does not execute the contract and 
give the proper
security, the Commission may accept the next 
lowest bidder, or readvertise
and relet in manner above 
provided.
    
(f) In case any work shall be abandoned by
any contractor 
or design-build entity, the Commission may, if the best 
interests of the Commission
be thereby served, adopt on behalf 
of the Commission all subcontracts made
by such contractor or 
design-build entity for such work and all such sub-contractors 
shall be
bound by such adoption if made; and the Commission 
shall, in the manner
provided in this Act, readvertise and 
relet, or request proposals and award design-build contracts 
for, the work specified in the original
contract exclusive of 
so much thereof as shall be accepted. Every contract
when made 
and entered into, as provided in this Section or Section 20.20, 
shall be executed, held by the Commission, and filed
in
its 
records, and one copy of which shall be given to the contractor 
or design-build entity.


    
(g) The provisions of this Section with respect to 
design-build shall have no effect beginning on June 1, 
2023
 
2018
; provided that any design-build contracts entered into 
before such date or any procurement of a project under this Act 
commenced before such date, and the contracts resulting from 
those procurements, shall remain effective. The actions of any 
person or entity taken on or after June 1, 2013 and before the 
effective date of this amendatory Act of the 98th General 
Assembly in reliance on the provisions of this Section with 
respect to design-build continuing to be effective are hereby

(Section scheduled to be repealed on June 1, 2018)
    
Sec. 20.5. 
Procedures for design-build selection.
    
(a) The Commission must use a two-phase procedure for the

selection of the
successful design-build entity. Phase I of the 
procedure will evaluate and
shortlist the design-build 
entities based on qualifications, and Phase II
will
evaluate 
the technical and cost proposals.
    
(b) The Commission shall include in the request for 
proposal
the
evaluating factors to be used in Phase I. These 
factors are in addition to any
prequalification requirements of 
design-build entities that the Commission has set
forth. Each 
request for proposal shall establish the relative importance

assigned to each evaluation factor and subfactor, including any 
weighting of
criteria to be employed by the Commission. The 
Commission must maintain a
record of the evaluation scoring to 
be disclosed in event of a protest
regarding the solicitation.

    
The Commission shall include the following criteria in 
every
Phase I
evaluation of design-build entities: (1) 
experience of personnel; (2)
successful
experience with 
similar project types; (3) financial capability; (4) 
timeliness
of past performance; (5) experience with similarly 
sized projects; (6)
successful reference checks of the firm;  
(7) commitment to assign personnel
for the duration of the 
project and qualifications of the entity's consultants; and (8) 
ability or past performance in meeting or exhausting good faith 
efforts to meet the utilization goals for minority and women 
business enterprises established by the corporate authorities 
of the Commission and in complying with Section 2-105 of the 
Illinois Human Rights Act.  The Commission may include any 
additional relevant criteria in Phase I that it deems necessary 
for a proper qualification review.


    
The Commission may not consider any design-build entity for

evaluation or
award if the entity has any pecuniary interest in 
the project or has other
relationships or circumstances, 
including but not limited to, long-term
leasehold, mutual 
performance, or development contracts with the Commission,

that may give the design-build entity a financial or tangible 
advantage over
other design-build entities in the preparation, 
evaluation, or performance of
the
design-build contract or that 
create the appearance of impropriety. No design-build proposal 
shall be considered that does not include an entity's plan to 
comply with the requirements established in the minority and 
women business enterprises and economically disadvantaged 
firms established by the corporate authorities of the 
Commission and with Section 2-105 of the Illinois Human Rights 
Act.

    
Upon completion of the qualifications evaluation, the 
Commission shall
create a shortlist of the most highly 
qualified design-build entities. The
Commission, in its 
discretion, is not required to shortlist the
maximum number of

entities as identified for Phase II evaluation, provided 
however, no less than
2
design-build entities nor more than 6 
are selected to submit Phase II
proposals.

    
The Commission shall notify the entities selected for the

shortlist in
writing. This notification shall commence the 
period for the preparation of the
Phase II technical and cost 
evaluations. The Commission must
allow sufficient
time for the 
shortlist entities to prepare their Phase II submittals

considering
the scope and detail requested by the Commission.

    
(c) The Commission shall include in the request for 
proposal
the
evaluating factors to be used in the technical and 
cost submission components
of Phase II.  Each request for 
proposal shall establish, for both the technical
and cost 
submission components of Phase II, the relative importance 
assigned to
each evaluation factor and subfactor, including any 
weighting of criteria to be
employed by the Commission. The 
Commission must
maintain a record of the
evaluation scoring to 
be disclosed in event of a protest regarding the
solicitation.

    
The Commission shall include the following criteria in 
every
Phase II
technical evaluation of design-build entities: 
(1) compliance with objectives
of
the
project; (2) compliance 
of proposed services to the request for proposal
requirements; 
(3) quality of products or materials proposed; (4) quality of

design parameters; (5) design concepts; (6) innovation in 
meeting the scope and
performance criteria; and (7) 
constructability of the
proposed project. The Commission may 
include any additional
relevant
technical evaluation factors 
it deems necessary for proper selection.

    
The Commission shall include the following criteria in 
every
Phase II cost
evaluation: the guaranteed maximum project 
cost and the time of
completion. The Commission may include any 
additional relevant
technical
evaluation factors it deems 
necessary for proper selection. The guaranteed maximum project 
cost criteria weighing factor shall not exceed 30%.

    
The Commission shall directly employ or retain a licensed

design
professional to evaluate the technical and cost 
submissions to determine if the
technical submissions are in 
accordance with generally
accepted industry standards.

    
Upon completion of the technical submissions and cost 
submissions evaluation,
the Commission may award the 
design-build contract to the
highest
overall ranked entity.

    
(d) This Section is repealed on June 1, 
2023

that any design-build contracts entered into before such date 
or any procurement of a project under this Act commenced before 
such date, and the contracts resulting from those procurements,

(50 ILCS 20/23.5)
    
Sec. 23.5. 
Continuation of Sections 2.5, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 
20.10, 20.15, 20.20, and 20.25 of this Act; validation.
 
    
(a) The General Assembly finds and declares that:
    
    
(1) When Public Act 95-595 (effective June 1, 2008) 
amended the Public Building Commission Act, it provided 
repeal dates for Sections 2.5, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.10, 
20.15, 20.20, and 20.25 of this Act of 5 years after the 
effective date of Public Act 95-595 (June 1, 2013). 
    
    
(2) Senate Bill 2233 of the 98th General Assembly 
contained provisions that would have changed the repeal 
dates of  Sections 2.5, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.10, 20.15, 
20.20, and 20.25 of this Act from 5 years after the 
effective date of Public Act 95-595 to June 1, 2018. Senate 
Bill 2233 passed both houses on May 31, 2013. Senate Bill 
2233 provided that it took effect upon becoming law. Senate 
Bill 2233 was sent to the Governor on June 10, 2013. Senate 
Bill 2233 was approved by the Governor on August 9, 2013. 
Senate Bill 2233 became Public Act 98-299. 
    
    
(3) The Statute on Statutes sets forth general rules on
    
the repeal of statutes and the construction of multiple
    
amendments, but Section 1 of that Act also states that
    
these rules will not be observed when the result would be
    
"inconsistent with the manifest intent of the General
    
Assembly or repugnant to the context of the statute". 
    
    
(4) The actions of the General Assembly
    clearly 
manifest the intention of the General Assembly to extend
    
the repeal of Sections 2.5, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.10, 20.15, 
20.20, and 20.25 of this Act and have those Sections
    
continue in effect 
until June 1, 2018
. 
    
    
(5) Sections 2.5, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.10, 20.15, 
20.20, and 20.25 of this Act were
    originally enacted to 
protect, promote, and preserve the
    general welfare. Any 
construction of this Act that results
    in the repeal of 
those Sections on June 1, 2013 would be
    inconsistent with 
the manifest intent of the General
    Assembly and repugnant 
to the context of this  Act. 
    
(b) It is hereby declared to have been the intent of the

General Assembly, in enacting Public Act  98-299, that Sections 
2.5, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.10, 20.15, 20.20, and 20.25 of this 
Act be changed to make June 1, 2018 the repeal date of Sections 
2.5, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.10, 20.15, 20.20, and 20.25 of this 
Act, and that  Sections 2.5, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.10, 20.15, 
20.20, and 20.25 of this Act therefore not be subject to repeal 
on June 1, 2013.
    
(c) Sections 2.5, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.10, 20.15, 20.20, 
and 20.25 of this Act shall be
deemed to have been in 
continuous effect since June 1, 2008
(the effective date of 
Public Act 95-595), and shall
continue to be in effect 
henceforward 
until June 1, 2018, unless they are otherwise

lawfully repealed
. All previously enacted amendments to this 
Act
taking effect on or after June 1, 2013 are hereby

validated. 
    
(d) All actions taken in reliance on or pursuant to 
Sections 2.5, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.10, 20.15, 20.20, and 20.25 
of this Act by the Public Building Commission or any other 
person or entity are hereby validated.
    
(e) In order to ensure the continuing effectiveness of 
Sections 2.5, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.10, 20.15, 20.20, and 20.25 
of this Act, those Sections are set forth in
full and reenacted 
by this amendatory Act of the 98th General
Assembly. This 
reenactment is intended as a continuation of
those Sections. It 
is not intended to supersede any amendment to the
Act that is 
enacted by the 98th General Assembly.
    
(f) In this amendatory Act of the 98th General Assembly, 
the base text of the reenacted Sections is set forth as amended 
by Public Act 98-299.  Striking and underscoring is used only to 
show changes being made to the base text. In this instance, no 
underscoring or striking is shown in the base text because no 
additional changes are being made. 
    
(g) Sections 2.5, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.10, 20.15, 20.20, 
and 20.25 of this Act apply
to all claims, civil actions, and 
proceedings pending on or
filed on or before the effective date 
of this amendatory Act of the 98th General Assembly.
