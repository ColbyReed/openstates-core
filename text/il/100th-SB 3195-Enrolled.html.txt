Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois,
 
represented in the General Assembly:

  

 
    
Section 5. 
The Food Handling Regulation Enforcement Act is 
amended  by changing Sections 3.3 and 3.4 as follows:
    
(410 ILCS 625/3.3)
    
(Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 100-488
)
    
Sec. 3.3. 
Farmers' markets.
 
    
(a) The General Assembly finds as follows:
    
    
(1) Farmers' markets, as defined  in subsection (b) of 
this Section,  provide not only a valuable marketplace for 
farmers and food artisans to sell their products directly 
to consumers, but also a place for consumers to access 
fresh fruits, vegetables, and other agricultural products.
    
    
(2) Farmers' markets serve as a stimulator for local 
economies and for thousands of new businesses every year, 
allowing farmers to sell directly to consumers and capture 
the full retail value of their products. They have become 
important community institutions and have figured in the 
revitalization of downtown districts and rural 
communities.
    
    
(3) Since 1999, the number of farmers' markets has 
tripled and new ones are being established every year.   
There is a lack of consistent regulation from one county to 
the next, resulting in confusion and discrepancies between 
counties regarding how products may be sold. 
There 
continues to be inconsistencies, confusion, and lack of 
awareness by consumers, farmers, markets, and local health 
authorities of required guidelines affecting farmers' 
markets from county to county.
    
    
(4) 
(Blank).
 
In 1999, the Department of Public Health  
published Technical Information Bulletin/Food #30 in order 
to outline the food handling and sanitation guidelines 
required for farmers' markets, producer markets, and other 
outdoor food sales events.
    
    
(5) 
(Blank).
 
While this bulletin was revised in 2010,  
there continues to be inconsistencies, confusion, and lack 
of awareness by consumers, farmers, markets, and local 
health authorities of required guidelines affecting 
farmers' markets from county to county.
    
(b) For the purposes of this Section:
    
"Department" means the Department of Public Health.
    
"Director" means the Director of Public Health.
    
"Farmers' market" means a common facility or area  where the 
primary purpose is for farmers to gather to sell a variety of 
fresh  fruits and vegetables and other locally produced farm and 
food products  directly to consumers.
    
(c) 
(Blank).
 
In order to facilitate the orderly and uniform 
statewide implementation of the standards established in the 
Department of Public Health's administrative rules for this 
Section,  the Farmers' Market Task Force shall be formed by the 
Director to assist the Department in implementing statewide 
administrative regulations for farmers' markets.
    
(d)

This Section does not intend and shall not be construed 
to limit the power of counties, municipalities, and other local 
government units to regulate farmers' markets for the 
protection of the public health, safety, morals, and welfare, 
including, but not limited to, licensing requirements and time, 
place, and manner restrictions.  This Section provides for a 
statewide scheme for the orderly and consistent interpretation 
of the Department of Public Health administrative rules 
pertaining to the safety of food and food products sold at 
farmers' markets.
    
(e) 
(Blank).
 
The Farmers' Market Task Force shall consist

(j) 
(Blank).
 
The Task Force shall advise the Department 
regarding the content of any administrative rules adopted under

than those farmers' market sanitation regulations 
contained in the administrative rules adopted by the 
Department for the purposes of implementing this Section 
and Sections 3.4, 3.5, and 4 of this Act. Except as 
provided for in Sections 3.4 and 4 of this Act, this 
Section does not intend and shall not be construed to limit

farmers' markets or conducting related inspections and 
enforcement activities, so long as those permits and

Sec. 3.3. 
Farmers' markets.
 
    
(a) The General Assembly finds as follows:
    
    
(1) Farmers' markets, as defined  in subsection (b) of 
this Section,  provide not only a valuable marketplace for 
farmers and food artisans to sell their products directly 
to consumers, but also a place for consumers to access 
fresh fruits, vegetables, and other agricultural products.
    
    
(2) Farmers' markets serve as a stimulator for local 
economies and for thousands of new businesses every year, 
allowing farmers to sell directly to consumers and capture 
the full retail value of their products. They have become 
important community institutions and have figured in the 
revitalization of downtown districts and rural 
communities.
    
    
(3) Since 1999, the number of farmers' markets has 
tripled and new ones are being established every year.   
There is a lack of consistent regulation from one county to 
the next, resulting in confusion and discrepancies between 
counties regarding how products may be sold. 
There 
continues to be inconsistencies, confusion, and lack of 
awareness by consumers, farmers, markets, and local health 
authorities of required guidelines affecting farmers'

While this bulletin was revised in 2010,  
there continues to be inconsistencies, confusion, and lack 
of awareness by consumers, farmers, markets, and local 
health authorities of required guidelines affecting 
farmers' markets from county to county.
    
    
(6) Recognizing that farmers' markets serve as small 
business incubators and that farmers' profit margins 
frequently are narrow, even in direct-to-consumer retail, 
protecting farmers from costs of regulation that are 
disproportionate to their profits will help ensure the 
continued viability of these local farms and small 
businesses. 
    
(b) For the purposes of this Section:
    
"Department" means the Department of Public Health.
    
"Director" means the Director of Public Health.
    
"Farmers' market" means a common facility or area  where the 
primary purpose is for farmers to gather to sell a variety of 
fresh  fruits and vegetables and other locally produced farm and 
food products  directly to consumers.
    
"Task Force" means the Farmers' Market Task Force.
 
    
(c) 
(Blank).
 
In order to facilitate the orderly and uniform 
statewide implementation and affordability of the standards 
established in the Department administrative rules for this 
Section,  the Farmers' Market Task Force shall be formed by the 
Director to assist the Department in implementing statewide 
administrative regulations for farmers' markets.
    
(d)

This Section does not intend and shall not be construed 
to limit the power of counties, municipalities, and other local 
government units to regulate farmers' markets for the

Sec. 3.4. 
Product samples.
    
(a) For the purpose of this Section, "food product 
sampling" means food product samples distributed free of charge 
for promotional or educational purposes only.
    
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, except as 
provided in subsection (c) of this Section, a vendor who 
engages in food product sampling at a farmers' market may do so 
without obtaining a State or local permit to provide those food 
product samples, provided the vendor complies with the State 
and local permit requirements to sell the food product to be 
sampled and with the food preparation, food handling, food 
storage, and food sampling requirements specified in the 
administrative rules adopted by the Department to implement 
Section 3.3 and Section 3.4 of this Act.
    
The Department of Public Health is instructed to 
work with 
the Farmers' Market Task Force as created in Section 3.3 of 
this Act to
 establish a food sampling at farmers' market 
training and certification program to fulfill this 
requirement. The Department shall adopt rules for the food 
sampling training and certification program and product 
sampling requirements at farmers' markets 
in accordance with 
subsection (j) of Section 3.3
. The Department may charge a 
reasonable fee for the training and certification program. The 
Department may delegate or contract authority to administer the 
food sampling training to other qualified public and private 
entities.
    
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of 
this Section, the Department of Public Health, the Department 
of Agriculture, a local municipal health department, or a 
certified local health department may inspect a vendor at a 
farmers' market to ensure compliance with the provisions in 
this Section. If an imminent health hazard exists or  a vendor's 
product has been found to be misbranded, adulterated, or not in 
compliance with the permit exemption for vendors pursuant to 
this Section, then the regulatory authority may invoke 
cessation of sales until it deems that the situation has been 
addressed.
