(10 ILCS 5/10-3)
  
(from Ch. 46, par. 10-3)






    
Sec. 10-3. 
Nomination of independent candidates (not 
candidates of
any political party), for any office to be filled 
by the voters of the
State at large may also be made by 
nomination papers signed in the
aggregate for each candidate by 
the number of qualified voters required of an established party 
candidate under subsection (a) of Section 7-10
 
1% of the number 
of voters who voted in
the next preceding Statewide general 
election or 25,000 qualified voters
of the State, whichever is 
less
.  Nominations of independent candidates
for public office 
within any district or political subdivision less than
the 
State, may be made by nomination papers signed in the aggregate 
for
each candidate by 
the number of qualified voters of the 
district or political subdivision required of an established 
party candidate for the office under Section 7-10
 
qualified 
voters of such district, or political
subdivision, equaling not 
less than 5%, nor more than 8% (or 50 more
than the minimum, 
whichever is greater) of the number of persons, who
voted at 
the next preceding regular election in such district or

political subdivision in which such district or political 
subdivision
voted as a unit for the election of officers to 
serve its respective
territorial area. However, whenever the 
minimum
signature requirement for an independent candidate 
petition for a
district or political subdivision office shall 
exceed the minimum number
of signatures for an independent 
candidate petition for an office to be
filled by the voters of 
the State at large at the next preceding
State-wide general 
election, such State-wide petition signature
requirement shall 
be the minimum for an independent candidate petition
for such 
district or political subdivision office
.  For the first

election following a redistricting of congressional districts,

nomination papers for an independent candidate for congressman 
shall be
signed by 
the number of qualified voters of the 
congressional district required of an established party 
candidate under subsection (b) of Section 7-10
 
at least 5,000 
qualified voters of the congressional district
.
For the first 
election following a redistricting of legislative
districts, 
nomination papers for an independent candidate for State

Senator in the General Assembly shall be signed by 
the number 
of qualified voters of the legislative district required of an 
established party candidate under Section 8-8
 
at
least 3,000 
qualified voters of the legislative district
.  For the first

election following a redistricting of representative 
districts, nomination
papers for an independent candidate for 
State Representative in the General
Assembly shall be signed by 
the number of qualified voters of the representative district 
required of an established party candidate under Section 8-8
 
at 
least 1,500 qualified voters of the
representative district
.  
For the first election following redistricting of
county board 
districts, or of municipal wards or districts, or for the
first 
election following the initial establishment of such districts 
or
wards in a county or municipality, nomination papers
for an 
independent candidate for county board member, or for alderman 
or
trustee of such municipality, shall be signed by 
the number 
of qualified voters of the district or ward required of an 
established party candidate for the office under Section 7-10
 
qualified voters of the
district or ward equal to not less than 
5% nor more than 8% (or 50 more
than the minimum, whichever is 
greater) of the total number of votes cast
at the preceding 
general or general municipal election, as the case
may be, for 
the county or municipal office voted on throughout such county

or municipality for which the greatest total number of votes 
were cast for
all candidates, divided by the number of 
districts or wards, but in any
event not less than 25 qualified 
voters of the district or ward
.  Each voter
signing a nomination 
paper shall add to his signature his place of
residence, and 
each voter may subscribe to one nomination for such
office to 
be filled, and no more: Provided that the name of any
candidate 
whose name may appear in any other place upon the ballot shall

not be so added by petition for the same office.


    
The person circulating the petition, or the candidate on 
whose behalf
the petition is circulated, may strike any 
signature from the petition,
provided that;




    
    
(1) the person striking the signature shall initial the 
petition at
the place where the signature is struck; and




    
    
(2) the person striking the signature shall sign a 
certification
listing the page number and line number of 
each signature struck from
the petition.  Such 
certification shall be filed as a part of the
petition.




    
    
(3) the persons striking signatures from the petition 
shall each
sign an additional certificate specifying the 
number of certification
pages listing stricken signatures 
which are attached to the petition and
the page numbers 
indicated on such certifications.  The certificate
shall be 
filed as a part of the petition, shall be numbered, and 
shall
be attached immediately following the last page of 
voters' signatures
and before the certifications of 
stricken signatures.




    
    
(4) all of the foregoing requirements shall be 
necessary to effect a
valid striking of any signature.  The 
provisions of this Section
authorizing the striking of 
signatures shall not impose any criminal
liability on any 
person so authorized for signatures which may be

fraudulent.


    
In the case of the offices of Governor and Lieutenant 
Governor a
joint petition including one candidate for each of 
those offices must be
filed.



    
A candidate for whom a nomination paper has been filed as a 
partisan
candidate at a primary election, and who is defeated 
for his or her
nomination at the primary election, is 
ineligible to be placed on the
ballot as an independent 
candidate for election in that general or
consolidated 
election.


    
A candidate seeking election to an office for which 
candidates of
political parties are nominated by caucus who is 
a participant in the
caucus and who is defeated for his or
her 
nomination at such caucus, is ineligible to be listed on the 
ballot at
that general or consolidated election as an 
independent candidate.
