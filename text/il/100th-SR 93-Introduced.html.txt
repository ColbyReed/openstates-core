WHEREAS, Our national and State security should not be 
undermined
by the concerted efforts of foreign actors with the 
goal of
compromising our democratic ideals; and

  
    
WHEREAS, In July of 2016, the Illinois Board of Elections 
was the target of a cyber-attack of unknown foreign origin 
which targeted the
Illinois Voter Registration System 
Database; and

  
    
WHEREAS, On July 12, 2016, the IT staff at Illinois Board 
of Elections was made aware of performance issues with the 
Illinois Voter
Registration System (IVRS) database server, and 
processor usage had
spiked to 100% with no explanation; and
    
WHEREAS, Analysis of server logs revealed that the spike in 
usage
was a result of rapidly repeated database queries on the 
application
status page of the Paperless Online Voter 
Application (POVA) web site; and
    
WHEREAS, Additionally, Illinois State Board of Elections 
server
logs showed the database queries were a malicious form 
of cyber-attack
known as SQL Injection, which are unauthorized, 
malicious database
queries entered in a data field in a web 
application; and
    
WHEREAS, Further analysis of the web server logs showed 
that
malicious SQL queries began on June 23, 2016, and that 
malicious
traffic from the IP addresses continued, though it 
was blocked at the
firewall level; and
    
WHEREAS, Firewall monitoring indicated that the attackers 
were
hitting the Illinois State Board of Elections IP addresses 
five times per
second, 24 hours per day; and
    
WHEREAS, Investigations of the attack concluded Illinois 
Voter
Registration System passwords were compromised, and 
passwords included those of election authorities, their 
staffs, internal Illinois State
Board of Election users, 
vendors, and web services; and

  
    
WHEREAS, The intelligence community has described these

individuals or actors as part of foreign entities, namely 
Russia,
intent on boosting one candidate over the other; and

  
    
WHEREAS, Aggressive actions contrary to American interests 
that
foster political chaos and institutional mistrust in our 
democratic
values must be thoroughly repudiated; and

  
    
WHEREAS, The American public also needs assurance that law 
enforcement is
actively investigating these matters, and if 
further investigation
finds evidence that foreign actors 
perpetrated or directed such acts,
appropriate criminal 
charges and sanctions will be announced and
enforced; 
therefore, be it

  
    
RESOLVED, BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDREDTH GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, that we denounce any threats 
by Russia or any other
foreign actors who seek to interfere 
with the sanctity of our
democratic process; and be it further

  
    
RESOLVED, That such an attack on the United States of 
America and
the State of Illinois must not go undisclosed, and 
that we urge that the Illinois State Board of Elections produce 
a
final comprehensive report outlining the nature of breach, an 
audit of
their IT systems, and that they enact preventative 
measures to ensure
that such cyber interference never occurs 
again; and be it further
    
RESOLVED, That a suitable copy of this resolution be 
delivered to Steve Sandvoss, Executive Director of the Illinois 
State Board of Elections.
