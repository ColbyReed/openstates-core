data for certain purposes; providing an appropriation

WHEREAS, Wood Treaters, Inc., later known as Wood Treaters,
LLC, was established as a Florida corporation on May 12, 1980,
and operated a wood treating facility from 1980 to 2010 at a
12.5-acre industrial complex known as Fairfax Street Wood
Treaters, located at 2610 Fairfax Street in Jacksonville, and
WHEREAS, Wood Treaters, LLC’s operations were inherently
dangerous to employees because the company used a wood treating
preservative called chromated copper arsenate, which includes a
concentrated inorganic form of arsenic, to pressure treat
utility poles, pilings, heavy timber items, and plywood lumber
products, and
WHEREAS, there is an extensive body of scientific evidence
documenting the toxicity of arsenic exposure when arsenic is
used to treat wood, and
WHEREAS, employees at the Fairfax Street Wood Treaters site
were injured by excessive, persistent, and prolonged exposure to
toxic levels of arsenic while performing their work duties, and
WHEREAS, a catastrophic failure of the State of Florida to
enforce measures designed to protect employees from toxic
substances in the workplace resulted in the employees’ exposure
to arsenic, and
WHEREAS, over the course of its operating life, Wood
Treaters, LLC treated thousands of wood products, employed
hundreds of individuals at the Fairfax Street Wood Treaters
location, and was known to government regulators due to its
reckless and grossly negligent use and mismanagement of arsenic,
and
WHEREAS, the Department of Environmental Protection, the
Department of Financial Services, and the Department of Health
ignored the hazardous conditions that employees at the Fairfax
Street Wood Treaters site were working in, which were
exacerbated by employees receiving no training, protective gear,
or warnings and no guidance alerting them to the risks posed to
their health and safety by exposure to arsenic, and
WHEREAS, the State of Florida recognizes an equitable
obligation to redress the injuries and damages employees
sustained from exposures to arsenic as a result of the
catastrophic failure of the Department of Environmental
Protection, the Department of Financial Services, and the
Department of Health to exercise their duties, NOW, THEREFORE,

Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:

Section 1. The facts stated in the preamble to this act are
found and declared to be true.
Section 2. The Department of Health is directed to
collaborate with the National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health to develop accurate and reliable data on the exposure
levels and the duration and frequency of exposures to arsenic
for all former employees of Wood Treaters, LLC who worked at the
Fairfax Street Wood Treaters site, so as to ascertain the risks
to their health posed by such exposure.
Section 3. The sum of $10 million is appropriated from the
General Revenue Fund to the Office of the Attorney General for
the relief of former employees of Wood Treaters, LLC who
demonstrate personal injuries and damages resulting from
excessive, persistent, and prolonged exposure to arsenic as a
result of the work environment at the Fairfax Street Wood
Treaters site, and who demonstrate that such injuries and
damages were sustained as a result of the failure of state
agencies to exercise their statutory duties to control the
unlawful release of arsenic. The Attorney General shall
compensate each eligible former employee in the amount of
$100,000.
Section 4. The amount awarded under this act is intended to
provide the sole compensation for all present and future claims
arising out of the factual situation described in this act which
resulted in injuries and damages to former employees of Wood
Treaters, LLC. The total amount paid for attorney fees relating
to this claim may not exceed 25 percent of the amount awarded
under this act.
Section 5. This act shall take effect upon becoming a law.
