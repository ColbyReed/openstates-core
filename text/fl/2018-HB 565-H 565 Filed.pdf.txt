the excess credit hour surcharge requirement for
certain students; providing a separate excess hour
surcharge threshold for students enrolled in certain

Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
Section 1.         Subsection (2) of section 1009.286, Florida
Statutes, is amended to read:
1009.286         Additional student payment for hours exceeding
baccalaureate degree program completion requirements at state
universities.--
(2)     State universities shall require a student to pay an
excess hour surcharge for each credit hour in excess of the
number of credit hours required to complete the baccalaureate
degree program in which the student is enrolled. The excess hour
surcharge does not apply to a first-time-in-college student who
completes the requirements of his or her respective
baccalaureate degree program within 4 years. The excess hour
surcharge shall become effective for students who enter a state
university for the first time and maintain continuous enrollment
as follows:
(a)     For the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 academic years, an
excess hour surcharge equal to 50 percent of the tuition rate
for each credit hour in excess of 120 percent.
(b)     For the 2011-2012 academic year, an excess hour
surcharge equal to 100 percent of the tuition rate for each
credit hour in excess of 115 percent.
(c)     For the 2012-2013 academic year and thereafter, an
excess hour surcharge equal to 100 percent of the tuition rate
for each credit hour in excess of 110 percent. However, for
students enrolled in a degree program designated by the Board of
Governors as an area of strategic emphasis in a science,
technology, engineering, mathematics, or health discipline there
is an excess hour surcharge equal to 100 percent of the tuition
rate for each credit hour in excess of 120 percent.
Section 2.        This act shall take effect July 1, 2018.
