follows:
(a) Additions.—There shall be added to such taxable income:
1. The amount of any tax upon or measured by income,

accrued as a liability to the District of Columbia or any state
of the United States which is deductible from gross income in
the computation of taxable income for the taxable year.
2. The amount of interest which is excluded from taxable
income under s. 103(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or any other

3. In the case of a regulated investment company or real

Section 3. Section 220.197, Florida Statutes, is created to
read:
220.197 Tax credit for employment and support of employees
serving as family caregivers.—
(1) As used in this section, the term:
(a) “Caregiver-friendly employment policy” means a
business’s written policy that accommodates the employment and
personal needs of employees who must serve as family caregivers
and that provides both of the following:
1. Work flexibility for employees who are family caregivers
so they may balance work responsibilities with caring for their
disabled family members or elderly family members. Such policy
includes, but is not limited to, flexible work schedules and
telework. As used in this subparagraph, the term “telework”
means a work arrangement allowing an employee to conduct all or
some of his or her work away from the worksite during all or a
portion of the employee’s established work hours on a regular
basis.
2. Mental health support for family caregivers, which may
include, but is not limited to, counseling and psychotherapy
services provided at the workplace by a person licensed under
chapter 491.
(b) “Disabled family member” means a person who is a
relative of a family caregiver and who is diagnosed by a
physician licensed under chapter 458 or chapter 459 with a
condition of physical or mental incapacitation due to a
developmental disability, organic brain damage, or mental
illness, or who is diagnosed by the physician as having one or
more physical or mental limitations that restrict the person’s
ability to perform the normal activities of daily living.
(c) “Elderly family member” means a person who is a
relative of a family caregiver, is 65 years of age or older, and
is diagnosed by a physician licensed under chapter 458 or
chapter 459 as suffering from the infirmities of aging as
manifested by advanced age or organic brain damage or other
physical, mental, or emotional dysfunction, to the extent that
the ability of the person to provide adequately for his or her
own care or protection is impaired.
(d) “Family caregiver” means a person who has been
entrusted with or who has assumed responsibility for the care of
a disabled family member or an elderly family member.
(2) Pursuant to this section, a business is qualified for a
credit against the tax imposed by this chapter if the business:
(a) Is certified by the department as having a caregiver
friendly employment policy; and
(b) Has employed, for a minimum of 1 year as of the end of
the previous taxable year, at least one employee who is a family
caregiver.
(3) For taxable years beginning on or after January 1,
2019, a qualified business shall receive a tax credit for
previously paid corporate income taxes under this chapter equal
to 12.5 percent of the amount of wages paid by the business in
the previous taxable year to all employees who were family
caregivers and who were employed by the business for at least 1
year as of the end of the previous taxable year. The credit may
be taken only as a deduction on a corporate income tax return
and may not be received as a refund of taxes previously paid.
The credit taken in any taxable year may not exceed 50 percent
of the qualified business’ remaining net income tax liability
under this chapter after all other credits have been applied
under s. 220.02(8).
(4) To qualify for the credit under this section, a
business must apply to the department on a form approved by the
department. The application must include all information
required by the department to verify the business’ qualification
under subsection (2).
(5) Within 30 business days after receipt of the
application, the department shall notify the applicant in
writing as to whether the application has been approved or
deemed insufficient to support the credit. The department shall
identify any insufficiency in the written notice. If the
application is deemed insufficient, the applicant may reapply
for the credit within 90 calendar days after its receipt of the
written notice.
(6) If the credit approved under this section is not fully
used in a taxable year, the unused amount may be carried forward
for no more than 5 taxable years. The carryover credit may be
used if the tax imposed by this chapter for such taxable year
exceeds the credit under this section after the business applies
other credits and unused credit carryovers in the order provided
in s. 220.02(8).
(7) The department may adopt rules to administer this
section.
Section 4. This act shall take effect July 1, 2018.
