Section 1. Paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section

327.70 Enforcement of this chapter and chapter 328.—
(2)(a)1. Upon demonstrated compliance with the safety
equipment carriage and use requirements of this chapter during a
safety inspection initiated by a law enforcement officer, the
operator of a vessel shall be issued a safety inspection decal
signifying that the vessel is deemed to have met the safety
equipment carriage and use requirements of this chapter at the
time and location of such inspection. The commission may
designate by rule the timeframe for expiration of, and the
specific design for, the safety inspection decal. However, a
decal may not be valid for less than 1 calendar year or more

specified in this paragraph. All decals issued by the commission
on or before December 31, 2018, are no longer valid after that
date.
2. The safety inspection decal, if displayed, must be
located within 6 inches of the inspected vessel’s properly
displayed vessel registration decal. For nonmotorized vessels
that are not required to be registered, the safety inspection
decal, if displayed, must be located above the waterline on the
forward half of the port side of the vessel.
Section 2. This act shall take effect January 1, 2019.
