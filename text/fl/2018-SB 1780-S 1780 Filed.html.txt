WHEREAS, the Florida State Reform School, also known as the
“Florida Industrial School for Boys,” the “Florida School for
Boys,” the “Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys,” and the “Dozier
School,” was opened by the state in 1900 in Marianna to house
children who had committed minor criminal offenses, such as
incorrigibility, truancy, and smoking, as well as more serious
offenses, such as theft and murder, and
WHEREAS, throughout the Dozier School’s history, reports of
abuse, suspicious deaths, and threats of closure plagued the
school, and
WHEREAS, many former students of the Dozier School have
sworn under oath that they were beaten at a facility located on
the school grounds known as the “White House,” and
WHEREAS, a psychologist employed at the Dozier School
testified under oath at a 1958 United States Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing that boys at the school were beaten by an
administrator, that the blows were severe and dealt with great
force with a full arm swing over the head and down, that a
leather strap approximately 10 inches long was used, and that
the beatings were “brutality,” and
WHEREAS, a former Dozier School employee stated in
interviews with law enforcement that, in 1962, several employees
of the school were removed from the facility based upon
allegations that they made sexual advances toward boys at the
facility, and
WHEREAS, a forensic investigation funded by the Legislature
and conducted from 2013 to 2016 by the University of South
Florida found incomplete records regarding deaths and 45 burials
that occurred at the Dozier School between 1900 and 1960 and
found that families were often notified of the death after the
child was buried or were denied access to their child’s remains
at the time of burial, and
WHEREAS, the excavations conducted as part of the forensic
investigation revealed more burials than reported in official
records, and
WHEREAS, in 1955, this state opened a new reform school in
Okeechobee called the Florida School for Boys at Okeechobee,
referred to in this act as “the Okeechobee School,” to address
overcrowding at the Dozier School, and staff members of the
Dozier School were transferred to the Okeechobee School, where
similar disciplinary practices were implemented, and
WHEREAS, many former students of the Okeechobee School have
sworn under oath that they were beaten at a facility on school
grounds known as the “Adjustment Unit,” and
WHEREAS, more than 500 former students of the Dozier School
and the Okeechobee School have come forward with reports of
physical, mental, and sexual abuse by school staff during the
1940s, 1950s, and 1960s and the resulting trauma that has
endured throughout their lives, and
WHEREAS, during the 2017 legislative session, the
Legislature unanimously issued a formal apology to the victims
of abuse with the passage of CS/SR 1440 and CS/SR 1335,
expressing regret for the treatment of boys who were sent to the
Dozier School and the Okeechobee School; acknowledging that the
treatment was cruel, unjust, and a violation of human decency;
and expressing its commitment to ensure that children who have
been placed in this state’s care will be protected from abuse
and violations of human decency, NOW, THEREFORE,

Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
