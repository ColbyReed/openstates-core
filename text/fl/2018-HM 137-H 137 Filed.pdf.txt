House Memorial
A memorial to the Congress of the United States,
urging Congress to propose to the states an amendment
to the United States Constitution that allows Congress
to deem a law that has been declared void by certain
federal courts active and operational and that allows
a state to deem a law that has been declared void by
that state's courts active and operational.
WHEREAS, the judicial branch has taken on an increasingly
activist role aimed at molding legislation according to the
political beliefs of its members, and
WHEREAS, such an activist posture tends to excessively
consolidate power in one branch of government, and
WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court and the states'
respective highest courts currently possess what operationally
amounts to ultimate and unchecked authority on matters of the
constitutionality of the United States' laws and the states'
respective laws, and
WHEREAS, the United States Congress may submit proposed
constitutional amendments for consideration and ratification by
the states, NOW, THEREFORE,
Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
That the Florida Legislature respectfully petitions the
United States Congress to propose to the states an amendment to
the United States Constitution providing that any law,
resolution, or other legislative act declared void by the United
States Supreme Court or a United States court of appeals may be
deemed active and operational, notwithstanding the court's
ruling, if agreed to by Congress pursuant to a joint resolution
adopted by a 60 percent vote of each chamber of Congress within
5 years after the date the ruling becomes final, and that any
state law, resolution, or other legislative act declared void by
the respective state's appellate or highest court may be deemed
active and operational, notwithstanding the court's ruling, if
agreed to by such respective state's legislature pursuant to a
joint resolution adopted by a 60 percent vote of each chamber of
such state's legislature within 5 years after the date the
ruling becomes final, unless such 60 percent vote threshold is
revised by such state through its constitutional amendment
process. Such a joint resolution shall take effect immediately
upon passage.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that copies of this memorial be
dispatched to the President of the United States, to the
President of the United States Senate, to the Speaker of the
United States House of Representatives, and to each member of
the Florida delegation to the United States Congress.
