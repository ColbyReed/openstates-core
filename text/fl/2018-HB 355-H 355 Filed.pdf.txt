921.0026(1) and (2)(m), 921.00265(1), 924.06(1)(e),

Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
Section 1.         Subsection (2) of section 921.0024, Florida
Statutes, is amended to read:
921.0024         Criminal Punishment Code; worksheet computations;
scoresheets.--
(2)(a)      The lowest permissible sentence is the minimum
sentence that may be imposed by the trial court, absent a valid
reason for departure.
(b)1.       For offenses committed on or after October 1, 1998,
and before October 1, 2018, the lowest permissible sentence is
any nonstate prison sanction in which the total sentence points
equals or is less than 44 points, unless the court determines
within its discretion that a prison sentence, which may be up to
the statutory maximums for the offenses committed, is
appropriate. When the total sentence points exceeds 44 points,
the lowest permissible sentence in prison months shall be
calculated by subtracting 28 points from the total sentence
points and decreasing the remaining total by 25 percent.
2.      For offenses committed on or after October 1, 2018, the
lowest permissible sentence is any nonstate prison sanction in
which the total sentence points equals or is less than 52
points, unless the court determines within its discretion that a
prison sentence, which may be up to the statutory maximums for
the offenses committed, is appropriate. When the total sentence
points exceeds 52 points, the lowest permissible sentence in
prison months shall be calculated by subtracting 36 points from
the total sentence points and decreasing the remaining total by
25 percent.
(c)      The total sentence points shall be calculated only as
a means of determining the lowest permissible sentence. The
permissible range for sentencing shall be the lowest permissible
sentence up to and including the statutory maximum, as defined
in s. 775.082, for the primary offense and any additional
offenses before the court for sentencing. The sentencing court
may impose such sentences concurrently or consecutively.
However, any sentence to state prison must exceed 1 year. If the
lowest permissible sentence under the code exceeds the statutory
maximum sentence as provided in s. 775.082, the sentence
required by the code must be imposed. If the total sentence
points are greater than or equal to 363, the court may sentence
the offender to life imprisonment. An offender sentenced to life
imprisonment under this section is not eligible for any form of
discretionary early release, except executive clemency or
conditional medical release under s. 947.149.
Section 2.        For the purpose of incorporating the amendment
made by this act to section 921.0024, Florida Statutes, in a
reference thereto, subsection (10) of section 775.082, Florida
Statutes, is reenacted to read:
775.082       Penalties; applicability of sentencing structures;
mandatory minimum sentences for certain reoffenders previously
released from prison.--
(10)        If a defendant is sentenced for an offense committed
on or after July 1, 2009, which is a third degree felony but not
a forcible felony as defined in s. 776.08, and excluding any
third degree felony violation under chapter 810, and if the
total sentence points pursuant to s. 921.0024 are 22 points or
fewer, the court must sentence the offender to a nonstate prison
sanction. However, if the court makes written findings that a
nonstate prison sanction could present a danger to the public,
the court may sentence the offender to a state correctional
facility pursuant to this section.
Section 3.        For the purpose of incorporating the amendment
made by this act to section 921.0024, Florida Statutes, in a
reference thereto, subsection (1) of section 921.00241, Florida
Statutes, is reenacted to read:
921.00241        Prison diversion program.--
(1)     Notwithstanding s. 921.0024 and effective for offenses
committed on or after July 1, 2009, a court may divert from the
state correctional system an offender who would otherwise be
sentenced to a state facility by sentencing the offender to a
nonstate prison sanction as provided in subsection (2). An
offender may be sentenced to a nonstate prison sanction if the
offender meets all of the following criteria:
(a)     The offender's primary offense is a felony of the
third degree.
(b)     The offender's total sentence points score, as
provided in s. 921.0024, is not more than 48 points, or the
offender's total sentence points score is 54 points and 6 of
those points are for a violation of probation, community
control, or other community supervision, and do not involve a
new violation of law.
(c)     The offender has not been convicted or previously
convicted of a forcible felony as defined in s. 776.08, but
excluding any third degree felony violation under chapter 810.
(d)     The offender's primary offense does not require a
minimum mandatory sentence.
Section 4.         For the purpose of incorporating the amendment
made by this act to section 921.0024, Florida Statutes, in
references thereto, subsection (1) and paragraph (m) of
subsection (2) of section 921.0026, Florida Statutes, is
reenacted to read:
921.0026         Mitigating circumstances.--This section applies to
any felony offense, except any capital felony, committed on or
after October 1, 1998.
(1)     A downward departure from the lowest permissible
sentence, as calculated according to the total sentence points
pursuant to s. 921.0024, is prohibited unless there are
circumstances or factors that reasonably justify the downward
departure. Mitigating factors to be considered include, but are
not limited to, those listed in subsection (2). The imposition
of a sentence below the lowest permissible sentence is subject
to appellate review under chapter 924, but the extent of
downward departure is not subject to appellate review.
(2)     Mitigating circumstances under which a departure from
the lowest permissible sentence is reasonably justified include,
but are not limited to:
(m)     The defendant's offense is a nonviolent felony, the
defendant's Criminal Punishment Code scoresheet total sentence
points under s. 921.0024 are 60 points or fewer, and the court
determines that the defendant is amenable to the services of a
postadjudicatory treatment-based drug court program and is
otherwise qualified to participate in the program as part of the
sentence. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "nonviolent
felony" has the same meaning as provided in s. 948.08(6).
Section 5.        For the purpose of incorporating the amendment
made by this act to section 921.0024, Florida Statutes, in a
reference thereto, subsection (1) of section 921.00265, Florida
Statutes, is reenacted to read:
921.00265        Recommended sentences; departure sentences;
mandatory minimum sentences.--This section applies to any felony
offense, except any capital felony, committed on or after
October 1, 1998.
(1)     The lowest permissible sentence provided by
calculations from the total sentence points pursuant to s.
921.0024(2) is assumed to be the lowest appropriate sentence for
the offender being sentenced. A departure sentence is prohibited
unless there are mitigating circumstances or factors present as
provided in s. 921.0026 which reasonably justify a departure.
Section 6.        For the purpose of incorporating the amendment
made by this act to section 921.0024, Florida Statutes, in a
reference thereto, paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of section
924.06, Florida Statutes, is reenacted to read:
924.06      Appeal by defendant.--
(1)     A defendant may appeal from:
(e)     A sentence imposed under s. 921.0024 of the Criminal
Punishment Code which exceeds the statutory maximum penalty
provided in s. 775.082 for an offense at conviction, or the
consecutive statutory maximums for offenses at conviction,
unless otherwise provided by law.
Section 7.        For the purpose of incorporating the amendment

points or fewer, the offense is a nonviolent felony, the
defendant is amenable to substance abuse treatment, and the
