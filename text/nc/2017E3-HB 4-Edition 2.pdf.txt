SECTION 1.1. This act shall be known as "The Hurricane Florence Emergency
Response Act."
PART II. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS
DAMAGE CAUSED BY HURRICANE FLORENCE
SECTION 2.1.(a) The General Assembly finds that Hurricane Florence was one of
the strongest storms to form in the Atlantic Ocean in the history of North Carolina, reaching wind
speeds of up to 140 miles an hour and covering 500 miles; making landfall on September 14,
2018; causing heavy rainfall, record flooding, high storm surge, and dozens of deaths in the State
as of the date of this act; and necessitating the declaration of a State of Emergency for the State
by the Governor and a Major Disaster Declaration by the President of the United States for
multiple counties in the State.
SECTION 2.1.(b) The General Assembly finds that as a result of Hurricane Florence
the following has occurred:
(1)     Central and southeastern North Carolina suffered significant damage to public
and private property.
(2)     Essential utility services and systems and other critical infrastructure have
been seriously disrupted.
(3)     Over 880,000 people have lost power, thousands of people have been
displaced from their homes, and 1,600 roads have been closed.
(4)     Riverine flooding began at the start of Hurricane Florence, and the effects
continue to be felt across the State. Several large rivers reached and exceeded
major flooding levels.
(5)     As of the date of this act, twenty-eight of the State's counties have been
declared a major disaster by the President of the United States under the
Stafford Act (P.L. 93-288), with others requested and pending approval.
(6)     North Carolinians have lost their lives, their loved ones, their homes, their
communities, their schools and houses of worship, their life savings, their
businesses and places of employment, their possessions, their pets, and their
ways of life.
(7)     Entire towns throughout eastern North Carolina were flooded to the rooftops
as the record storm surge combined with water levels of rivers and streams
crested at flood-stage heights far beyond those ever seen before in this State.
(8)     Thirty-four states assisted North Carolina in addressing the devastation caused
by Hurricane Florence.
(9)     Thousands of emergency responders, National Guard members, and other
volunteers worked to respond and assist disaster areas during and after the
time the storm made landfall.
(10)    Swift action by the General Assembly is necessary to provide relief to and
facilitate recovery efforts for the citizens of North Carolina devastated from
the Hurricane.
(11)    Assessments from the damages resulting from Hurricane Florence are
ongoing, and Public Assistance projects are in planning stages to repair
facilities and roads, remove debris, and otherwise effectuate cleanup and
repair.
(12)    Further assistance by the General Assembly will be needed on behalf of the
people and local governments who have suffered damage to public buildings,
roads, wastewater treatment plants, and other critical infrastructure.

not expended, made subject to an encumbrance, or disbursed to another entity at the end of each
