 2   AN ACT TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION OF NORTH CAROLINA TO PROVIDE FOR
 3       NONPARTISAN JUDICIAL MERIT COMMISSIONS FOR THE NOMINATION AND
 4       RECOMMENDATION OF NOMINEES WHEN FILLING VACANCIES IN THE OFFICE
 5       OF JUSTICE OR JUDGE OF THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE AND TO MAKE
 6       OTHER CONFORMING CHANGES TO THE CONSTITUTION.
 7   The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:
 8               SECTION 1. Article IV of the North Carolina Constitution is amended by adding a
 9   new section to read:
10   "Sec. 23. Merit selection; judicial vacancies.
11       (1)     All vacancies occurring in the offices of Justice or Judge of the General Court of
12   Justice shall be filled as provided in this section. Appointees shall hold their places until the next
13   election following the election for members of the General Assembly held after the appointment
14   occurs, when elections shall be held to fill those offices. When the vacancy occurs on or after the
15   sixtieth day before the next election for members of the General Assembly and the term would
16   expire on December 31 of that same year, the Chief Justice shall appoint to fill that vacancy for
17   the unexpired term of the office.
18       (2)     In filling any vacancy in the office of Justice or Judge of the General Court of Justice,
19   individuals shall be nominated on merit by the people of the State to fill that vacancy. In a manner
20   prescribed by law, nominations shall be received from the people of the State by a nonpartisan
21   commission established under this section, which shall evaluate each nominee without regard to
22   the nominee's partisan affiliation, but rather with respect to whether that nominee is qualified or
23   not qualified to fill the vacant office, as prescribed by law. The evaluation of each nominee of
24   people of the State shall be forwarded to the General Assembly, as prescribed by law. The
25   General Assembly shall recommend to the Governor, for each vacancy, at least two of the
26   nominees deemed qualified by a nonpartisan commission under this section. For each vacancy,
27   within 10 days after the nominees are presented, the Governor shall appoint the nominee the
28   Governor deems best qualified to serve from the nominees recommended by the General
29   Assembly.
30       (3)     The Nonpartisan Judicial Merit Commission shall consist of no more than nine
31   members whose appointments shall be allocated between the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,
32   the Governor, and the General Assembly, as prescribed by law. The General Assembly shall, by
33   general law, provide for the establishment of local merit commissions for the nomination of
34   judges of the Superior and District Court. Appointments to local merit commissions shall be
35   allocated between the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Governor, and the General
36   Assembly, as prescribed by law. Neither the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Governor,

 1   nor the General Assembly shall be allocated a majority of appointments to a nonpartisan
 2   commission established under this section.
 3        (4)     If the Governor fails to make an appointment within 10 days after the nominees are
 4   presented by the General Assembly, the General Assembly shall elect, in joint session and by a
 5   majority of the members of each chamber present and voting, an appointee to fill the vacancy in
 6   a manner prescribed by law.
 7        (5)     If the General Assembly has adjourned sine die or for more than 30 days jointly as
 8   provided under Section 20 of Article II of this Constitution, the Chief Justice shall have the
 9   authority to appoint a qualified individual to fill a vacant office of Justice or Judge of the General
10   Court of Justice if any of the following apply:
11                (a)     The vacancy occurs during the period of adjournment.
12                (b)     The General Assembly adjourned without presenting nominees to the
13                        Governor as required under subsection (2) of this section or failed to elect a
14                        nominee as required under subsection (4) of this section.
15                (c)     The Governor failed to appoint a recommended nominee under subsection (2)
16                        of this section.
17        (6)     Any appointee by the Chief Justice shall have the same powers and duties as any other
18   Justice or Judge of the General Court of Justice, when duly assigned to hold court in an interim
19   capacity, and shall serve until the earlier of:
20                (a)     Appointment by the Governor.
21                (b)     Election by the General Assembly.
22                (c)     The first day of January succeeding the next election of the members of the
23                        General Assembly, and such election shall include the office for which the
24                        appointment was made.
25   However, no appointment by the Governor or election by the General Assembly to fill a judicial
26   vacancy shall occur after an election to fill that judicial office has commenced, as prescribed by
27   law."

33   Court must sit in at least one place in each county. District Judges shall be elected for each district
34   for a term of four years, in a manner prescribed by law. When more than one District Judge is
35   authorized and elected for a district, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall designate one
36   of the judges as Chief District Judge. Every District Judge shall reside in the district for which
37   he is elected.
38        (2)     For each county, the senior regular resident Judge of the Superior Court serving the

41   appointment for a magistrate shall be for two years and subsequent terms shall be for four years.
42        (3)     The number of District Judges and Magistrates shall, from time to time, be determined
43   by the General Assembly. Vacancies in the office of District Judge shall be filled for the
44   unexpired term in a manner prescribed by law. Vacancies in the office of Magistrate shall be
45   filled for the unexpired term in the manner provided for original appointment to the office, unless
46   otherwise provided by the General Assembly."

50   appointment of the Governor, and the appointees shall hold their places until the next election
51   for members of the General Assembly that is held more than 60 days after the vacancy occurs,
