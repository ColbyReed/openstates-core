17       (a1) A murder shall be presumed "willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing" under

28                               same victim is the subject of the domestic violence protective order;
29                       b.      Any crime in which assault is an element;
30                       c.      Communicating threats (G.S. 14-277.1) or harassing phone calls
31                               (G.S. 14-196); or
32                       d.      Any felony listed in G.S. 15A-830.
33               (2)     The perpetrator has previously stalked the victim, as defined in

     General Assembly Of North Carolina                                                    Session 2017
 1       (b)     A murder other than described in subsection (a) or (a1) of this section or in
 2   G.S. 14-23.2 shall be deemed second degree murder. Any person who commits second degree
 3   murder shall be punished as a Class B1 felon, except that a person who commits second degree
 4   murder shall be punished as a Class B2 felon in either of the following circumstances:
 5               (1)     The malice necessary to prove second degree murder is based on an
 6                       inherently dangerous act or omission, done in such a reckless and wanton
 7                       manner as to manifest a mind utterly without regard for human life and
 8                       social duty and deliberately bent on mischief.
 9               (2)     The murder is one that was proximately caused by the unlawful distribution
10                       of opium or any synthetic or natural salt, compound, derivative, or
11                       preparation of opium, or cocaine or other substance described in
12                       G.S. 90-90(1)d., or methamphetamine, and the ingestion of such substance
13                       caused the death of the user.
14       (c)     For the purposes of this section, it shall constitute murder where a child is born alive
15   but dies as a result of injuries inflicted prior to the child being born alive. The degree of murder
16   shall be determined as described in subsections (a) and (b) of this section."
17               SECTION 2. This act becomes effective December 1, 2017, and applies to
18   offenses committed on or after that date.
