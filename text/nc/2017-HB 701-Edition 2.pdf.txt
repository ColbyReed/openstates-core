     General Assembly Of North Carolina                                                    Session 2017
 1                    You are hereby notified that the opinion expressed herein is not a legal
 2                    determination. An occupational licensing board does not have the authority to
 3                    order you to discontinue your current practices. Only a court may determine that
 4                    you have violated or are violating any law and, if appropriate, impose a remedy
 5                    or penalty for the violation. Further, pursuant to G.S. 150B-4, you may have the
 6                    right, prior to initiation of any court action by the occupational licensing board,
 7                    to request a declaratory ruling regarding whether your particular conduct is
 8                    lawful. You are further notified that any right to a declaratory ruling
 9                    supplements any other legal rights that you may already have to establish the
10                    legality of your conduct with respect to the goods or services you offer or
11                    provide.
12   "§ 93B-19. Venue for court enforcement.
13       The venue for occupational licensing boards seeking a court order for injunctive relief or to
14   show cause for failure to comply with a subpoena lawfully issued by the occupational licensing
15   board shall be in the superior court of the county where the defendant resides or in the county
16   where the occupational licensing board has its principal place of business.
17   "§ 93B-20. Injunctive relief.
18       An occupational licensing board may appear in its own name in superior court in actions for
19   injunctive relief to restrain the violation of the provisions of a statute administered by the board
20   or a rule or order of the board. The superior court shall have the jurisdiction to grant these
21   injunctions or restraining orders or take other appropriate action even if criminal prosecution
22   has been or may be instituted as a result of the violations, or whether the person is a licensee of
23   the board. No board shall issue such orders independently of the superior court unless
24   specifically authorized to do so by law.
25   "§ 93B-21. Jurisdictional disputes between boards.
26       It is the policy of the State that jurisdictional disputes among occupational licensing boards
27   shall be resolved through informal procedures. If a jurisdictional dispute among occupational
28   licensing boards cannot be resolved through informal procedures, any affected board may
29   commence an administrative proceeding to resolve the jurisdictional dispute by filing a petition
30   with the Office of Administrative Hearings and serving the petition on all affected boards.
31   Once the petition is filed and the required fee is paid, the dispute shall become a contested case
32   and shall be conducted by the Office of Administrative Hearings under Articles 3 and 4 of
33   Chapter 150B of the General Statutes.
34   "§ 93B-22. Complaint process.
35       Each occupational licensing board shall develop and implement a complaint process that
36   provides for all of the following:
37                (1)     A description of the complaint process on the board's Web site, including the
38                        types of violations that are under the jurisdictional authority of the board.
39                (2)     Electronic complaint submission via the board's Web site, including a
40                        prominently displayed link to a complaint form.
41                (3)     The ability to provide complainants with a written description of the final
42                        disposition of each complaint."
43                SECTION 6.(b) The complaint process provided for in G.S. 93B-22 shall be
44   implemented and active on each board's Web site no later than January 1, 2018.

47       The clear proceeds of all civil penalties, civil forfeitures, and civil fines that are collected

 2   proceeds of these funds include the full amount of all civil penalties, civil forfeitures, and civil
 3   fines collected under authority conferred by the State, diminished only by the actual costs of
 4   collection, not to exceed twenty percent (20%) of the amount collected. The collection cost
 5   percentage to be used by a State agency shall be established and approved by the Office of
 6   State Budget and Management on an annual basis based upon the computation of actual
 7   collection costs by each agency for the prior fiscal year. Occupational licensing boards as
 8   defined in G.S. 93B-1 shall satisfy the annual reporting obligation imposed under this section

21   G.S. 93B-2."
