A BILL TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT TO CLARIFY THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE IN PRIVATE NUISANCE
ACTIONS AGAINST AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY OPERATIONS.
The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:
SECTION 1. Article 57 of Chapter 106 of the General Statutes is amended by
adding a new section to read:
"ยง 106-702. Limitations on private nuisance actions against agricultural and forestry
operations.
(a)      The compensatory damages that may be awarded to a plaintiff for a private nuisance
action where the alleged nuisance emanated from an agricultural or forestry operation shall be
as follows:
(1)     If the nuisance is a permanent nuisance, compensatory damages shall be
measured by the reduction in the fair market value of the plaintiff's property
caused by the nuisance, but not to exceed the fair market value of the
property.
(2)     If the nuisance is a temporary nuisance, compensatory damages shall be
limited to the diminution of the fair rental value of the plaintiff's property
caused by the nuisance.
(b)      If any plaintiff or plaintiff's successor in interest brings a subsequent private
nuisance action against any agricultural or forestry operation, the combined recovery from all
such actions shall not exceed the fair market value of his or her property. This limitation
applies regardless of whether the subsequent action or actions were brought against a different
defendant than the preceding action or actions.
(c)      This Article shall apply to any private nuisance claim brought against any party
based on that party's contractual or business relationship with an agricultural or forestry
operation."
SECTION 2.(a) This act is effective when it becomes law and applies to actions
filed, arising, or pending on or after that date.
SECTION 2.(b) If any section or provision of this act is declared unconstitutional
or invalid by the courts, it does not affect the validity of this act as a whole or any part other
than the part declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
