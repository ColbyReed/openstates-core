 6   The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:
 7                SECTION 1. G.S. 130A-310.7 reads as rewritten:
 8   "ยง 130A-310.7. Action for reimbursement; liability of responsible parties; notification of
 9                completed remedial action.
10       (a)      Notwithstanding any other provision or rule of law, and subject only to the defenses
11   set forth in this subsection, any person who:
12                (1)     Discharges or deposits; or
13                (2)     Contracts or arranges for any discharge or deposit; or
14                (3)     Accepts for discharge or deposit; or
15                (4)     Transports or arranges for transport for the purpose of discharge or deposit
16   any hazardous substance, the result of which discharge or deposit is the existence of an inactive
17   hazardous substance or waste disposal site, shall be considered a responsible party. Neither an
18   innocent landowner who is a bona fide purchaser of the inactive hazardous substance or waste
19   disposal site without knowledge or without a reasonable basis for knowing that hazardous
20   substance or waste disposal had occurred nor a person whose interest or ownership in the
21   inactive hazardous substance or waste disposal site is based on or derived from a security
22   interest in the property shall be considered a responsible party. A responsible party shall be
23   directly liable to the State for any or all of the reasonably necessary expenses of developing and
24   implementing a remedial action program for such site. The Secretary shall bring an action for
25   reimbursement of the Inactive Hazardous Sites Cleanup Fund in the name of the State in the
26   superior court of the county in which the site is located to recover such sum and the cost of
27   bringing the action. The State must show that a danger to the public health or the environment
28   existed and that the State complied with the provisions of this Part.
29       (b)      There shall be no liability under this section for a person who can establish by a
30   preponderance of the evidence that the danger to the public health or the environment caused
31   by the site was caused solely by:
32                (1)     An act of God; or
33                (2)     An act of war; or
34                (3)     An intentional act or omission of a third party (but this defense shall not be
35                        available if the act or omission is that of an employee or agent of the

 1                       defendant, or if the act or omission occurs in connection with a contractual
 2                       relationship with the defendant); or
 3               (4)     Any combination of the above causes.
 4       (b1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, there shall be no liability under this
 5   section for a person who arranges for recycling of recyclable materials with respect to such
 6   materials if that person has complied with all standards, requirements, and criteria set forth in
 7   the Superfund Recycling Equity Act of 1999, 42 U.S.C. ยง 9627, as amended.
 8       (c)     The definitions set out in G.S. 130A-310.31(b) apply to this subsection. Any person
 9   may submit a written request to the Department for a determination that a site that is subject to
10   this Part has been remediated to unrestricted use standards as provided in Part 5 of Article 9 of
11   Chapter 130A of the General Statutes. A request for a determination that a site has been
12   remediated to unrestricted use standards shall be accompanied by the fee required by
13   G.S. 130A-310.39(a)(2). If the Department determines that the site has been remediated to
14   unrestricted use standards, the Department shall issue a written notification that no further
15   remediation will be required at the site. The notification shall state that no further remediation
16   will be required at the site unless the Department later determines, based on new information or
17   information not previously provided to the Department, that the site has not been remediated to
18   unrestricted use standards or that the Department was provided with false or incomplete
19   information. Under any of those circumstances, the Department may withdraw the notification
20   and require responsible parties to remediate the site to unrestricted use standards."
21               SECTION 2. This act is effective when it becomes law.
