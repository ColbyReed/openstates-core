 2                                       this subdivision.
 3                     e.       Qualified retirement facilities whose property is excluded from
 4                              property tax under G.S. 105-278.6A.
 5                     f.       A university-affiliated nonprofit organization that procures, designs,

 7                              institution of The University of North Carolina. For purposes of this
 8                              sub-subdivision, a nonprofit organization includes an entity exempt
 9                              from taxation as a disregarded entity of the nonprofit organization.

20                     to the same extent as if purchased directly by the entity that holds the
21                     exemption certificate. A real property contractor that purchases an item

31                     by a nonprofit entity through reimbursement to an authorized person of the
32                     entity for tax incurred by the person on an item or transaction subject to tax
33                     under Article 5 of this Chapter.

35                     subsection for a fiscal year may not exceed thirty-one million seven hundred
36                     thousand dollars ($31,700,000) in tax. A real property contractor who pays
37                     local sales and use taxes on property qualifying for an exemption under this
38                     subdivision on behalf of an entity shall give the entity for whose project the

41                     for which the property was used, (iv) if the property was purchased in this
42                     State, the county in which it was purchased, and (v) if the property was not
43                     purchased in this State, the county in which the property was used. If the
44                     property was purchased in this State, the real property contractor shall attach
45                     a copy of the sales or purchase receipt to the statement.

 1   application for exemption must be in the form required by the Secretary, be signed by a person
 2   with authority to bind the entity, and contain any information required by the Secretary. The
 3   Secretary must assign a sales tax exemption number to a nonprofit entity that submits a proper
 4   application.
 5       (b)     Liability. – A nonprofit entity that does not use the items purchased with its
 6   exemption number must pay the tax that should have been paid on the items purchased, plus
 7   interest calculated from the date the tax would otherwise have been paid."
 8               SECTION 4. G.S. 105-467(b) reads as rewritten:
 9       "(b) Exemptions and Refunds. – The State exemptions and exclusions contained in
10   G.S. 105-164.13 and G.S. 105-164.27A Article 5 of this Chapter apply to the local sales and
11   use tax authorized to be levied and imposed under this Article. The State refund provisions
12   contained in G.S. 105-164.14 through G.S. 105-164.14B and G.S. 105-164.14A apply to the
13   local sales and use tax authorized to be levied and imposed under this Article. A refund of an
14   excessive or erroneous State sales tax collection allowed under G.S. 105-164.11 and a refund of
15   State sales tax paid on a rescinded sale or cancelled service contract under G.S. 105-164.11A
16   apply to the local sales and use tax authorized to be levied and imposed under this Article. The
17   aggregate annual local refund exemption amount allowed an entity under G.S. 105-164.14(b)
18   G.S. 105-164.13(52a) for a fiscal year may not exceed thirteen million three hundred thousand
19   dollars ($13,300,000).($13,300,000) in tax.
20       Except as provided in this subsection, a taxing county may not allow an exemption,
21   exclusion, or refund that is not allowed under the State sales and use tax. A local school
22   administrative unit and a joint agency created by interlocal agreement among local school
23   administrative units pursuant to G.S. 160A-462 to jointly purchase food service-related
24   materials, supplies, and equipment on their behalf is allowed an annual refund of sales and use
25   taxes paid by it under this Article on direct purchases of tangible personal property and
26   services. Sales and use tax liability indirectly incurred by the entity on building materials,
27   supplies, fixtures, and equipment that become a part of or annexed to any building or structure
28   that is owned or leased by the entity and is being erected, altered, or repaired for use by the
29   entity is considered a sales or use tax liability incurred on direct purchases by the entity for the
30   purpose of this subsection. The refund allowed under this subsection does not apply to
31   purchases of electricity, telecommunications service, ancillary service, piped natural gas, video
32   programming, or a prepaid meal plan. A request for a refund is due in the same time and
33   manner as provided in G.S. 105-164.14(c). Refunds applied for more than three years after the
34   due date are barred."
35               SECTION 5. G.S. 105-236(a)(5a) reads as rewritten:
36               "(5a) Misuse of Exemption Certificate. – For misuse of an exemption certificate
37                       by a purchaser, the Secretary shall assess a penalty equal to two hundred
38                       fifty dollars ($250.00). An exemption certificate is a certificate issued by the
39                       Secretary that authorizes a retailer to sell tangible personal property to the
40                       holder of the certificate and either collect tax at a preferential rate or not
41                       collect tax on the sale. Examples of an exemption certificate include a
42                       certificate of exemption, a direct pay certificate, and a conditional exemption
43                       certificate. Misuse under this subdivision includes improper use of a
44                       certificate of exemption issued to a nonprofit entity pursuant to
45                       G.S. 105-164.29C for direct and indirect purchases by the entity or another

47               SECTION 6. This act becomes effective October 1, 2017, and applies to sales and
48   purchases made on or after that date. This act does not affect the rights or liabilities of the State,
49   a taxpayer, or another person arising under a statute amended or repealed by this act before the
50   effective date of its amendment or repeal, nor does it affect the right to any refund or credit of a
