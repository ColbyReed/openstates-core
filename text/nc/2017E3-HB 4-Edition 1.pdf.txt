11   DAMAGE CAUSED BY HURRICANE FLORENCE
12               SECTION 2.1.(a) The General Assembly finds that Hurricane Florence was one of
13   the strongest storms to form in the Atlantic Ocean in the history of North Carolina, reaching wind
14   speeds of up to 140 miles an hour and covering 500 miles; making landfall on September 14,
15   2018; causing heavy rainfall, record flooding, high storm surge, and dozens of deaths in the State
16   as of the date of this act; and necessitating the declaration of a State of Emergency for the State
17   by the Governor and a Major Disaster Declaration by the President of the United States for
18   multiple counties in the State.
19               SECTION 2.1.(b) The General Assembly finds that as a result of Hurricane Florence
20   the following has occurred:
21               (1)     Central and southeastern North Carolina suffered significant damage to public

 1              (2)     Essential utility services and systems and other critical infrastructure have
 2                      been seriously disrupted.
 3              (3)     Over 880,000 people have lost power, thousands of people have been
 4                      displaced from their homes, and 1,600 roads have been closed.
 5              (4)     Riverine flooding began at the start of Hurricane Florence, and the effects
 6                      continue to be felt across the State. Several large rivers reached and exceeded
 7                      major flooding levels.
 8              (5)     As of the date of this act, twenty-eight of the State's counties have been
 9                      declared a major disaster by the President of the United States under the
10                      Stafford Act (P.L. 93-288), with others requested and pending approval.
11              (6)     North Carolinians have lost their lives, their loved ones, their homes, their

14                      ways of life.
15              (7)     Entire towns throughout eastern North Carolina were flooded to the rooftops
16                      as the record storm surge combined with water levels of rivers and streams
17                      crested at flood-stage heights far beyond those ever seen before in this State.
18              (8)     Thirty-four states assisted North Carolina in addressing the devastation caused
19                      by Hurricane Florence.
20              (9)     Thousands of emergency responders, National Guard members, and other
21                      volunteers worked to respond and assist disaster areas during and after the
22                      time the storm made landfall.
23              (10)    Swift action by the General Assembly is necessary to provide relief to and
24                      facilitate recovery efforts for the citizens of North Carolina devastated from

28                      facilities and roads, remove debris, and otherwise effectuate cleanup and
29                      repair.
30              (12)    Further assistance by the General Assembly will be needed on behalf of the
31                      people and local governments who have suffered damage to public buildings,
32                      roads, wastewater treatment plants, and other critical infrastructure.

31   MOSQUITO VECTOR POPULATION CONTROL
32              SECTION 5.4. It is the intent of the General Assembly to prevent large populations
33   of floodwater mosquitoes from emerging following Hurricane Florence, as this could adversely
34   impact the public health by hindering the State's response and recovery efforts and increasing the
35   number of vector-borne illnesses. To that end, the General Assembly encourages the Department
36   of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, to continue to work with local health
37   departments to expedite mosquito control efforts in counties that are or become part of a disaster
38   declaration by the President of the United States under the Stafford Act (P.L. 93-288) as a result
39   of Hurricane Florence. For purposes of this section, mosquito control efforts include mosquito
