AN ACT TO MAKE VARIOUS CHANGES TO THE LAWS AFFECTING CHARTER
  SCHOOLS.

The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:

PART I. ALLOW EMPLOYEES OF EDUCATION OR CHARTER MANAGEMENT
ORGANIZATIONS TO SERVE AS TEACHERS
        SECTION 1. G.S. 115C-218.90(a)(1) reads as rewritten:
        "(1) An employee of a charter school is not an employee of the local school
             administrative unit in which the charter school is located. The charter
             school's board of directors shall employ and contract with necessary teachers
             or contract with an education management organization or charter
             management organization to employ and provide teachers to perform the
             particular service for which they are employed in the school; at least fifty
             percent (50%) of these teachers shall hold teacher licenses. All teachers who
             are teaching in the core subject areas of mathematics, science, social studies,
             and language arts shall be college graduates.
                 The board also may employ necessary employees who are not required
             to hold teacher licenses to perform duties other than teaching and may
             contract for other services. The board may discharge teachers and
             nonlicensed employees."

PART II. MODIFY THE DECISION TIME LINE FOR THE CHARTER SCHOOL
FAST-TRACK REPLICATION APPLICATION PROCESS
            SECTION 2.(a) Section 6.5 of S.L. 2014-101, as amended by Section 2 of S.L.
2016-79, reads as rewritten:
    "SECTION 6.5. Upon recommendations by the Office of Charter Schools and the Charter
Schools Advisory Board, the State Board of Education shall adopt a process and rules for
fast-track replication of high-quality charter schools currently operating in the State. The State
Board of Education shall not require a planning year for applicants selected through the
fast-track replication process. In addition to the requirements for charter applicants set forth in
Part 6A of Article 16 of Chapter 115C of the General Statutes, the fast-track replication process
adopted by the State Board of Education shall, at a minimum, require a board of directors of a
charter school to demonstrate one of the following in order to qualify for fast-track replication:
            (1)     A charter school in this State governed by the board of directors has student
                    academic outcomes that are comparable to the academic outcomes of
                    students in the local school administrative unit in which the charter school is
                    located and can provide three years of financially sound audits.
            (2)     The board of directors agrees to contract with an education management
                    organization or charter management organization that can demonstrate that it
                    can replicate high-quality charter schools in the State that have proven
                    student academic success and financial soundness.


                                      *H800-v-7*
The State Board of Education shall ensure that the rules for a fast-track replication process
provide that decisions by the State Board of Education on whether to grant a charter through
the replication process are completed in less than 120 days from the application submission
date. The State Board shall provide a decision no later than October 15 of the year immediately
preceding the year of the proposed school opening. The State Board of Education shall adopt
rules and procedures required by this section within 90 days of the effective date of this act, and
report to the Joint Legislative Education Oversight Committee within 120 days of the effective
date of this act."
