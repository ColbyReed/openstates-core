 2            (2)   Special allocation provisions. – In determining the use of the proceeds of
 3                  public school building bonds and notes, including premium thereon, if any,
 4                  set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection, the following special allocation
 5                  provisions apply:
 6                  a.      In the case of a local school administrative unit located entirely in one
 7                          county, the unit's total distribution amount shall be allocated to that
 8                          county. In the case of a local school administrative unit located in more
 9                          than one county, the unit's distribution amount shall be allocated
10                          among the counties in which the unit is located in proportion to
11                          average daily membership of the unit in each county. A unit's
12                          distribution amount allocated to a county may be used only with
13                          respect to public school facilities of that unit. If two or more local
14                          school administrative units are consolidated into one unit, the
15                          distribution amounts provided in subdivision (1) of this subsection for
16                          the units shall be considered the distribution amount for the merged
17                          unit.
18                  b.      Bond proceeds allocated in subdivision (1) of this subsection for
19                          low-wealth-county or small-county designations require no county
20                          match. A county receiving bond proceeds otherwise allocated in
21                          subdivision (1) of this subsection must match each one dollar of bond
22                          proceeds allocated with an amount equal to the product of three cents
23                          (3¢) multiplied by the county's ability to pay rank. A "county's ability
24                          to pay rank" is the rank assigned to the county by the State Board of
25                          Education for the 2016-17 fiscal year pursuant to Section 8.3 of
26                          S.L. 2015-241. The match requirement may be satisfied by non-State
27                          expenditures for public school facilities made on or after January 1,
28                          2017. If a debt has been authorized or incurred since January 1, 2017,
29                          for the general purpose of public school facilities, then the face amount
30                          of the debt shall be considered as a non-State expenditure for public
31                          school facilities for the purpose of the match. As counties satisfy the
32                          match requirements of this subsection, they shall document the extent
33                          to which they have done so in periodic reports to the State Board of
34                          Education. These reports shall include any information and
35                          documentation required by the State Board of Education. The State
36                          Board of Education shall certify to the State Treasurer from time to
37                          time the extent to which the match requirements of this subsection
38                          have been met with respect to each county. Bond proceeds shall be
39                          distributed for expenditure only as, and to the extent, the matching
40                          requirement of this section are satisfied, as certified by the State Board
41                          of Education. The State Board of Education shall also require counties
42                          to report annually on the impact of funds provided under this act on
43                          the property tax rate for that year. These reports shall be public
44                          documents and shall be furnished to any citizen upon request.
45                  c.      Unmatched proceeds. – If the State Board of Education determines that
46                          a county has not met the matching requirement of this subsection by
47                          January 1, 2024, with respect to any bond proceeds allocated under
48                          subdivision (1) of this subsection, the State Board of Education shall
49                          certify that fact to the State Treasurer by March 1, 2024. Amounts that
50                          are allocated in the ADM Growth Allocation of bond proceeds under
51                          subdivision (1) of this subsection and that have not been certified as

 1                           matched by the State Board of Education by January 1, 2024, shall be
 2                           reallocated among the counties that have been certified as having met
 3                           the matching requirement for that allocation. The reallocation shall be
 4                           made among the eligible counties in proportion to the amount of ADM
 5                           Growth Allocations for those counties under subdivision (1) of this
 6                           subsection. Amounts that are allocated in the ADM Allocation of bond
 7                           proceeds under subdivision (1) of this subdivision and that have not
 8                           been certified as matched by the State Board of Education by January
 9                           1, 2024, shall be reallocated among the counties that have been
10                           certified as having met the matching requirement for that allocation.
11                           The reallocation shall be made on the basis of average daily
12                           membership of the local school administrative units within the
13                           remaining counties. Bond proceeds reallocated to a county because of
14                           a local school administrative unit's average daily membership within
15                           the county may be used only with respect to public school capital
16                           outlay projects of that unit. Bond proceeds reallocated to a county
17                           under this sub-subdivision must be matched at the same rate as bond
18                           proceeds allocated to the county under sub-subdivision b. of this
19                           subdivision.

50                   expressly reserves the right to amend any provision of this section with respect
51                   to the making and repayment of loans, the disposition of any repayments of

     General Assembly Of North Carolina                                       First Extra Session 2018
 1                      loans, and any intercept provisions relating to the failure of a local government
 2                      unit to repay a loan, the bonds not being secured in any respect by loans, any
 3                      repayments thereof, or any intercept provisions with respect thereto.
 4               SECTION 1.(i) Variable Interest Rates. – In fixing the details of bonds and notes,
 5   the State Treasurer may provide that any of the bonds or notes may:
 6               (1)    Be made payable from time to time on demand or tender for purchase by the
 7                      owner thereof, provided a credit facility agreement supports the bonds or
 8                      notes, unless the State Treasurer specifically determines that a credit facility
 9                      agreement is not required, upon a finding and determination by the State
10                      Treasurer that the absence of a credit facility agreement will not materially or
11                      adversely affect the financial position of the State and the marketing of the
12                      bonds or notes at a reasonable interest cost to the State;
13               (2)    Be additionally supported by a credit facility agreement;
14               (3)    Be made subject to redemption or a mandatory tender for purchase prior to
15                      maturity;
16               (4)    Bear interest at a rate or rates that may vary for such period or periods of time,
17                      all as may be provided in the proceedings providing for the issuance of the
18                      bonds or notes, including, without limitation, such variations as may be
19                      permitted pursuant to a par formula; and
20               (5)    Be made the subject of a remarketing agreement whereby an attempt is made
21                      to remarket bonds or notes to new purchasers prior to their presentment for
22                      payment to the provider of the credit facility agreement or to the State.
23               If the aggregate principal amount repayable by the State under a credit facility
24   agreement is in excess of the aggregate principal amount of bonds or notes secured by the credit
25   facility agreement, whether as a result of the inclusion in the credit facility agreement of a
26   provision for the payment of interest for a limited period of time or the payment of a redemption
27   premium or for any other reason, then the amount of authorized but unissued bonds or notes
28   during the term of such credit facility agreement shall not be less than the amount of such excess,
29   unless the payment of such excess is otherwise provided for by agreement of the State executed
30   by the State Treasurer.
31               SECTION 1.(j) Interpretation of Section. –
32               (1)    Additional method. – The foregoing subsections of this section shall be
33                      deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the
34                      things authorized thereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and
35                      additional to powers conferred by other laws and shall not be regarded as in
36                      derogation of any powers now existing.
37               (2)    Statutory references. – References in this section to specific sections or
38                      Chapters of the General Statutes or to specific acts are intended to be
39                      references to these sections, Chapters, or acts as they may be amended from
40                      time to time by the General Assembly.
41               (3)    Broad construction. – The General Assembly specifically has chosen to
42                      combine what otherwise might be considered differing projects to be financed
43                      into one bond bill and bond question because the General Assembly finds that
44                      such differing projects, when taken together, constitute an interrelated, united,
45                      and single plan for the State's infrastructure as stated aforesaid. Accordingly,
46                      this section, being necessary for the health, welfare, and advancement of the
47                      people of the State, shall be broadly construed to affect the purposes thereof.
48               (4)    Inconsistent provisions. – Insofar as the provisions of this section are
49                      inconsistent with the provisions of any general laws, or parts thereof, the
50                      provisions of this section shall be controlling.

 1               (5)      Severability. – If any provision of this section or the application thereof to any
 2                        person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other
 3                        provisions or applications of the section that can be given effect without the
 4                        invalid provision or application, and to this end, the provisions of this section
 5                        are declared to be severable.
 6                SECTION 1.(k) Other Agreements. – The State Treasurer may authorize, execute,
 7   obtain, or otherwise provide for bond issuance, investment contracts, credit and liquidity

 9   instruments and matters the State Treasurer determines to be desirable in connection with the
10   issuance of bonds and notes.

12   improvement bonds and notes, including premium thereon, if any, issued pursuant to and for
13   projects listed in Section 1 of this act, shall administer, supervise, and ensure that use of the
14   proceeds comport with the purposes provided in this act. Each school administrative unit shall
15   submit to the State Board of Education its plans for the expenditure of proceeds allocated under
16   this act. After the State Board of Education determines that a school administrative unit's planned
17   expenditure of part or all of the proceeds allocated to it is within the purposes provided in this
18   act, the State Board of Education shall make the proceeds to which the plans apply available to
19   the school administrative unit. Each local school administrative unit receiving the proceeds of
20   public improvement bonds and notes, including premium thereon, if any, issued pursuant to and
21   for projects listed in Section 1 of this act shall report by January 1, 2019, and quarterly thereafter,

23   obligation bonds authorized by Section 1 of this act, and the Department of Public Instruction
24   shall combine the reports and submit them to the Joint Legislative Capital Oversight Committee,
25   the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee, and the Senate Committee on
26   Appropriations/Base Budget. Each report shall include the total project costs, the amount to be
27   funded from the bonds, the expenditures to date from the bonds and other sources, and the
28   percentage of each project completed.
29                SECTION 3.(a) Projects funded in whole or in part with the proceeds of public
30   improvement bonds and notes, including premium thereon, if any, issued pursuant to Section 1
31   of this act, and that portion of funds estimated to be needed for escalation of costs shall remain
32   with the Office of State Budget and Management and shall be disbursed only for the following
33   purposes:
34                (1)     To address unforeseen contingencies related to the specific project for which
35                        the funds were made available.
36                (2)     To address inflation costs related to that specific project.
37                SECTION 3.(b) Any funds retained by the Office of State Budget and Management
38   pursuant to subsection (a) of this section at the time a project is completed shall be retained by
39   the Office of State Budget and Management. The Office of State Budget and Management shall
