A BILL TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT TO CLARIFY POLITICAL PARTY DISCLOSURE ON THE BALLOT FOR
JUDICIAL RACES IN 2018.
Whereas, the General Assembly finds that the purpose of listing partisan affiliation
on the ballot in judicial races is to provide voters with information about candidates; and
Whereas, the General Assembly finds that political organizations and groups made
efforts to recruit candidates that could confuse voters as to candidates long-held partisan
affiliations; and
Whereas, the General Assembly finds that listing only partisan affiliations that a
candidate has held for 90 days prior to filing would reduce the opportunity for voter confusion;
and
Whereas, the General Assembly finds that a similar requirement exists for candidates
to run in a party primary for legislative or other partisan office under G.S. 163A-973; and
Whereas, the General Assembly finds that listing party affiliations held for 90 days
or more prior to the time of filing should apply to all judicial offices; and
Whereas, the General Assembly finds that it is possible a candidate who filed for
judicial office may not desire to remain on the ballot knowing only party affiliation held for 90
days or more will be disclosed on the ballot; and
Whereas, the General Assembly finds that providing a period allowing candidates to
withdraw from running for judicial office would provide opportunities for any judicial candidate
to be taken off the ballot;
Now, therefore, the General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:
SECTION 1. Section 4(b) of S.L. 2017-214 reads as rewritten:
"SECTION 4.(b) Form of Notice. – Each person offering to be a candidate for election shall
do so by filing a notice of candidacy with the State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement
in the following form, inserting the words in parentheses when appropriate:
Date ______________________________
I hereby file notice that I am a candidate for election to the office of _______________ in the
regular election to be held __________, __________.
Signed ______________________________
(Name of Candidate)
Witness:             _____________________________________________________________
The notice of candidacy shall be either signed in the presence of the chair or secretary
of the State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement or signed and acknowledged before an
officer authorized to take acknowledgments who shall certify the notice under seal. An
acknowledged and certified notice may be mailed to the State Board of Elections and Ethics
Enforcement. In signing a notice of candidacy, the candidate shall use only the candidate's legal
name and, in the candidate's discretion, any nickname by which commonly known. A candidate
may also, in lieu of that candidate's first name and legal middle initial or middle name, if any,
sign that candidate's nickname, provided the candidate appends to the notice of candidacy an
affidavit that the candidate has been commonly known by that nickname for at least five years
prior to the date of making the affidavit. The candidate shall also include with the affidavit the
way the candidate's name (as permitted by law) should be listed on the ballot if another candidate
with the same last name files a notice of candidacy for that office.
A notice of candidacy signed by an agent or any person other than the candidate shall
be invalid.
A candidate, at the time of filing the notice of candidacy under this section, shall
indicate on the notice of candidacy the political party recognized under Article 18 of Chapter
163A of the General Statutes with which that candidate is affiliated or any unaffiliated status.
The certificate required by subsection (d) of this section shall verify the party designation or
unaffiliated status, and the verified If the candidate's political party affiliation or unaffiliated
status is the same as on their voter registration at the time they filed to run for office and 90 days
prior to that filing, the political party designation or unaffiliated status shall be included on the
ballot."
SECTION 2. Section 2(a) of S.L. 2018-13 reads as rewritten:
"SECTION 2.(a) The General Assembly finds that both chambers of the General Assembly
have carefully examined judicial redistricting and the forms of judicial selection with multiple
committees considering various proposals of selection and new judicial district maps. The
General Assembly finds that, to allow for more time to thoughtfully consider these changes, the
General Assembly enacted S.L. 2017-214, the Electoral Freedom Act of 2017, which, among
other items, provided for a one-time cancellation of partisan primaries for the offices of district
court judge, superior court judge, judges of the Court of Appeals, and Supreme Court justices for
the 2018 election cycle. The General Assembly finds that all elections for judges in 2018 were
to be treated uniformly under S.L. 2017-214, the Electoral Freedom Act of 2017, while those
changes were considered.
The General Assembly notes that election to these offices will be held under a plurality
election system, with candidates running under a political party label on the ballot, without
having gone through a party primary. The General Assembly finds that ballot language above the
sections of 2018 general election ballots regarding these impacted offices setting forth that the
listed party affiliation is only the self-identified party of a candidate at least 90 days prior to the
time of filing willfiling, consistent with G.S. 163A-973, would aid voters' understanding of the
2018 judicial races."
SECTION 3. Section 2(c) of S.L. 2018-13 reads as rewritten:
"SECTION 2.(c) Notwithstanding G.S. 163A-1112, immediately prior to the placement of
the judicial offices listed in subsection (b) of this section on the ballot, the following information
shall be printed:
"No primaries for judicial office were held in 2018. The party information listed by each of
the following candidates' names indicates is shown only if the candidates' party affiliation or
unaffiliated status is the same as on their voter registration at the time they filed to run for
office.office and 90 days prior to that filing.""
SECTION 3.1. Section 4(c) of S.L. 2017-214 reads as rewritten:
"SECTION 4.(c) Withdrawal of Notice of Candidacy. – Any person who has filed a notice
of candidacy for an office under this section shall have the right to withdraw it at any time prior
to either of the following:
(1)     theThe close of business on the third business day prior to the date on which

section.

SECTION 3.2. The State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement shall notify, as
expeditiously as possible, all candidates for Justices and judges of the General Court of Justice

period from 90 days prior the time the candidate filed to run for office and the date the candidate
