PART V. IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT
AVERAGE DAILY MEMBERSHIP DETERMINATION
SECTION 5.1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in allocating funds for
the 2018-2019 fiscal year, the State Board of Education shall adjust the allotted average daily
membership (ADM) of public school units for the 2018-2019 school year in a manner that will
assist units impacted by Hurricane Florence as follows: Allotment adjustments for ADM
decreases shall be based on the highest of the first four months' ADM for public school units
located in counties designated under a major disaster declaration by the President of the United
States under the Stafford Act (P.L. 93-288) as a result of Hurricane Florence.
Consistent with the Allotment Adjustments for ADM Growth provisions of the NC

If the State Board of Education does not have sufficient resources in the ADM
Contingency Reserve line item to make allotment adjustments in accordance with this section,
the State Board of Education may use funds appropriated to State Aid for Public Schools for this

Hurricane Florence Emergency Grant Program for Postsecondary Students (Program) to provide
emergency scholarship grants in an amount up to one thousand two hundred fifty dollars ($1,250)

damage and destruction from Hurricane Florence. An emergency scholarship grant shall be used
to mitigate the impact of Hurricane Florence on a student so that his or her postsecondary
education in a North Carolina institution of higher education continues uninterrupted. These
funds may be used to cover any expenses that support a student's continued enrollment, including
costs related to transportation, textbooks, tuition, fees, and living expenses.
For the purposes of this section, an "institution of higher education" is defined as a

SECTION 5.3.(b) Applications; Eligibility. â€“ By November 1, 2018, each institution
of higher education that is eligible for an allocation of funds pursuant to this section shall begin
accepting applications from eligible postsecondary students. An application for an emergency
scholarship grant must demonstrate that the student is an eligible postsecondary student by
including documentation that the student meets the following criteria:

application.
(2)      The student has a financial need related to the impact of Hurricane Florence.
(3)      The student meets at least one of the following criteria:
a.       The institution of higher education in which the student was enrolled

scholarship grant to an eligible postsecondary student within two weeks of the receipt of the
application, or as soon as otherwise practicable, in an amount of up to one thousand two hundred
fifty dollars ($1,250) based on the information provided in the student's application. An
institution of higher education may establish priority in the award of emergency scholarship
grants to eligible postsecondary students based on the funds available and the pool of applicants,
including giving priority to students who have demonstrated the greatest financial need. If no
priority in the award of funds is established, the emergency scholarship grants shall be awarded
in the order in which applications are received. If the institution of higher education has
unexpended funds remaining after the award of the initial emergency scholarship grants, the
institution may increase the award to an eligible postsecondary student who previously received
funds or solicit additional applications from eligible postsecondary students, provided that the
award to an individual student does not exceed one thousand two hundred fifty dollars ($1,250)
for each academic semester in which funds are awarded.
SECTION 5.3.(d) Reimbursement for Losses Covered by Other Funds. â€“ An eligible
postsecondary student who receives an emergency scholarship grant under the Program shall use
best efforts and take all reasonable steps to obtain alternative funds that cover the losses or needs
for which the emergency scholarship grant funds are provided, including funds from insurance
policies in effect and available federal aid. If the student obtains alternative funds, the student

institution of higher education. A student is not required to remit any amount in excess of the
funds provided to the student.

NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS/REEMPLOYMENT
SECTION 5.9. G.S. 127A-202(a) reads as rewritten:
"(a) Release From State Duty. â€“ Upon an employee's release from state duty, the
employee's previous employer shall reemploy the employee in the employee's previous position
within five days of the employee's release from state duty. If the employee's state duty lasted 30
days or less, the employee shall make written application to the employee's previous employer

make written application to the employee's previous employer for reemployment within 14 days
of the employee's release from state duty. If the employee is still qualified for the employee's
previous employment, the employee shall be restored to the employee's previous position or to a
position of like seniority, status, and salary, unless the employer's circumstances now at that time
make the restoration unreasonable. If the employee is no longer qualified for the employee's
previous employment, the employee shall be placed in another position, position for which the

HURRICANE FLORENCE AGRICULTURAL DISASTER PROGRAM OF 2018
SECTION 5.11.(a) The General Assembly finds that:
(1)  The historic flood and other impacts of Hurricane Florence in September of
2018 caused unprecedented damage to the State and its people, with particular
devastating statewide impacts on North Carolina farmers and the State's
agriculture industry.
(2)  The State has over 50,000 farms across over 8 million acres, which generates
87 billion dollars of economic impact annually and represents the State's
number one industry, making it a vital component to a healthy state economy.
(3)  The total loss of crops as a result of the flooding is estimated at over a billion
dollars and the estimated federal crop insurance payments will only cover a
percentage of the total crop loss.
(4)  The federal crop insurance program as authorized in the 2014 Farm Bill is an
inadequate method of indemnification as compared to traditional forms of
insurance and is not sufficient to aid farmers with substantial losses due to
catastrophic events of nature.
(5)  The State has a significant public interest to prevent the economic collapse of
many of the State's farms, which could cause a severe disruption in the State's
economy and food supply chain.
(6)  The most effective program for administration of financial assistance is
two-fold. The first category shall be based on information available from the
Farm Service Agency ("FSA") within the United States Department of
Agriculture ("USDA"). The second category, for producers who do not
participate in FSA programs, shall be based on verifiable documentation from
producers.
SECTION 5.11.(b) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(1)  Agricultural commodity. â€“ Apples, barley, corn, cotton, dry peas, flax, forage,
freezing and canning peas, grain sorghum, grapes, hay, industrial hemp, native
grass, nursery crops, nuts, oats, peanuts, potatoes, rye, soybeans, sunflowers,
sweet corn, tobacco, tomatoes, wheat, specialty crops and other fruits and
vegetables, and aquacultural species propagated or reared in a controlled or
selected environment. An agricultural commodity does not include stored
grain.
(2)      Department. â€“ The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
(3)      Fund. â€“ The Hurricane Florence Agricultural Disaster Fund.
(4)      Livestock. â€“ Cattle, sheep, swine, goats, farmed cervids, and bison. Livestock
shall include horses, mules, or other equines only if they are used for

company, limited liability company, corporation, or other entity or group.
(6)     Poultry. â€“ Chickens, quail, or turkeys.
(7)     State. â€“ The State of North Carolina.
(8)     USDA. â€“ The United States Department of Agriculture.
SECTION 5.11.(c) The Hurricane Florence Disaster Fund is established as a special
fund in the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The Fund consists of allocations
directed by the General Assembly and contributions and grants from public or private sources.
The Fund shall be used for a financial assistance program that provides assistance to farmers
affected by Hurricane Florence. The Department may not use funds for administrative purposes.
Earnings on the contributions and grants deposited in the Fund shall be credited to the Fund. The
Fund shall expire upon the complete expenditure of funds allocated for the purposes specified
herein.
SECTION 5.11.(d) To be eligible for financial assistance for losses of agricultural
commodities, a person must satisfy all of the following criteria:

Carolina county that is or becomes any of the following:
a.      Designated under a major disaster declaration by the President of the
United States under the Stafford Act (P.L. 93-288) as a result of
Hurricane Florence.

(2)     The agricultural commodity was planted on or before September 13, 2018, or,
for aquaculture commodities, the commodities were being raised on or before
September 13, 2018.
SECTION 5.11.(e) A person seeking financial assistance for losses of agricultural
commodities shall submit to the Department a Form 578 on file with the USDA Farm Service
Agency or a form provided by the Department for reporting acreage or plantings of crops not
typically reported on Form 578, along with any other documentation deemed appropriate by the
Department, on or before December 10, 2018. For nursery crops, fruit-bearing trees and bushes,
and specialty crops where the survival level is not immediately known, the Department may
extend this deadline to May 1, 2019, upon written request by the person received on or before
December 10, 2018, and upon approval by the Department. A person receiving assistance under
this program must provide a signed affidavit, under penalty of perjury, certifying that each fact
of the loss presented by the person is accurate.

by the person is accurate.
SECTION 5.11.(h) The Department shall administer the financial assistance
program authorized by this section in accordance with the following criteria:
(1)     In determining the payment calculation for agricultural commodities, the
Department shall use a formula based on acreage, county loss estimates, and
USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service averages, and any other
measure the Department deems appropriate. Funds shall be distributed based
on county averages for yields and State averages for price. Calculations shall
be based on county or State averages in price, whichever the Department
determines is appropriate.
(2)     The payment calculation for livestock and poultry shall be based on twelve
and one-half percent (12.5%) of the total loss reported to the USDA Livestock
Indemnity Program.
(3)     The Department shall gather all claim information, except from those
applicants granted a deadline extension, no later than December 10, 2018. The
Department shall, as closely as possible, estimate the amount of the
appropriation needed to be held in reserve for payments related to losses of
livestock, poultry, nursery, bush, tree, and specialty crops for which losses
will not be fully known or calculated. The Department shall set aside funds as
it deems appropriate based on the estimated percentage of these losses.
(4)     Payments made under this program shall be made to the person who filed the
Form 578 or Department form for claims related to agricultural commodity
losses, or the person who received payment from the USDA Livestock

appraisals, ledgers of income, income statements of deposit slips, cash register tape, invoices for
custom harvesting, u-pick records, and insurance documents.
SECTION 5.11.(j) Awarded funds shall be used for agricultural production expenses
and recovery of losses due to the impacts of Hurricane Florence. The Department shall develop
guidelines and procedures to ensure that funds are expended for the purposes allowed by this
section, and may require any documentation it determines necessary to verify the appropriate use
of financial assistance awards including receipts. All distributed funds are subject to federal and
State income tax.
SECTION 5.11.(k) If the Department determines that a person who received
financial assistance provided inaccurate information, then the person shall refund the entire
amount of the financial assistance. If the person does not refund the appropriate amount, the
North Carolina Department of Revenue shall collect the money from the person pursuant to
