11       (1)     All vacancies occurring in the offices of Justice or Judge of the General Court of
12   Justice shall be filled as provided in this section. Appointees shall hold their places until the next
13   election following the election for members of the General Assembly held after the appointment
14   occurs, when elections shall be held to fill those offices. When the vacancy occurs on or after the
15   sixtieth day before the next election for members of the General Assembly and the term would
16   expire on December 31 of that same year, the Chief Justice shall appoint to fill that vacancy for
17   the unexpired term of the office.
18       (2)     In filling any vacancy in the office of Justice or Judge of the General Court of Justice,
19   individuals shall be nominated on merit by the people of the State to fill that vacancy. In a manner
20   prescribed by law, nominations shall be received from the people of the State by a nonpartisan
21   commission established under this section, which shall evaluate each nominee without regard to
22   the nominee's partisan affiliation, but rather with respect to whether that nominee is qualified or
23   not qualified to fill the vacant office, as prescribed by law. The evaluation of each nominee of
24   people of the State shall be forwarded to the General Assembly, as prescribed by law. The
25   General Assembly shall recommend to the Governor, for each vacancy, at least two of the
26   nominees deemed qualified by a nonpartisan commission under this section. For each vacancy,
27   within 10 days after the nominees are presented, the Governor shall appoint the nominee the
28   Governor deems best qualified to serve from the nominees recommended by the General
29   Assembly.
30       (3)     The Nonpartisan Judicial Merit Commission shall consist of no more than nine
31   members whose appointments shall be allocated between the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,
32   the Governor, and the General Assembly, as prescribed by law. The General Assembly shall, by
33   general law, provide for the establishment of local merit commissions for the nomination of
34   judges of the Superior and District Court. Appointments to local merit commissions shall be
35   allocated between the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Governor, and the General

 5   presented by the General Assembly, the General Assembly shall elect, in joint session and by a
 6   majority of the members of each chamber present and voting, an appointee to fill the vacancy in
 7   a manner prescribed by law.

11   Court of Justice if any of the following apply:

16                (c)     The Governor failed to appoint a recommended nominee under subsection (2)
17                        of this section.
18        (6)     Any appointee by the Chief Justice shall have the same powers and duties as any other
19   Justice or Judge of the General Court of Justice, when duly assigned to hold court in an interim
20   capacity, and shall serve until the earlier of:
21                (a)     Appointment by the Governor.
