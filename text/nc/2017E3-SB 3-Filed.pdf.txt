11   DAMAGE CAUSED BY HURRICANE FLORENCE
12               SECTION 2.1.(a) The General Assembly finds that Hurricane Florence was one of
13   the strongest storms to form in the Atlantic Ocean in the history of North Carolina, reaching wind
14   speeds of up to 140 miles an hour and covering 500 miles; making landfall on September 14,
15   2018; causing heavy rainfall, record flooding, high storm surge, and dozens of deaths in the State
16   as of the date of this act; and necessitating the declaration of a State of Emergency for the State
17   by the Governor and a Major Disaster Declaration by the President of the United States for
18   multiple counties in the State.
19               SECTION 2.1.(b) The General Assembly finds that as a result of Hurricane Florence
20   the following has occurred:
21               (1)     Central and southeastern North Carolina suffered significant damage to public
22                       and private property.
23               (2)     Essential utility services and systems and other critical infrastructure have
24                       been seriously disrupted.
25               (3)     Over 880,000 people have lost power, thousands of people have been
26                       displaced from their homes, and 1,600 roads have been closed.
27               (4)     Riverine flooding began at the start of Hurricane Florence, and the effects
28                       continue to be felt across the State. Several large rivers reached and exceeded
29                       major flooding levels.
30               (5)     As of the date of this act, twenty-eight of the State's counties have been
31                       declared a major disaster by the President of the United States under the
32                       Stafford Act (P.L. 93-288), with others requested and pending approval.
33               (6)     North Carolinians have lost their lives, their loved ones, their homes, their

 2                      ways of life.
 3              (7)     Entire towns throughout eastern North Carolina were flooded to the rooftops
 4                      as the record storm surge combined with water levels of rivers and streams
 5                      crested at flood-stage heights far beyond those ever seen before in this State.
 6              (8)     Thirty-four states assisted North Carolina in addressing the devastation caused
 7                      by Hurricane Florence.
 8              (9)     Thousands of emergency responders, National Guard members, and other
 9                      volunteers worked to respond and assist disaster areas during and after the
10                      time the storm made landfall.
11              (10)    Swift action by the General Assembly is necessary to provide relief to and
12                      facilitate recovery efforts for the citizens of North Carolina devastated from
13                      the Hurricane.
14              (11)    Assessments from the damages resulting from Hurricane Florence are
15                      ongoing, and Public Assistance projects are in planning stages to repair
16                      facilities and roads, remove debris, and otherwise effectuate cleanup and
17                      repair.
18              (12)    Further assistance by the General Assembly will be needed on behalf of the
19                      people and local governments who have suffered damage to public buildings,
20                      roads, wastewater treatment plants, and other critical infrastructure.

19   MOSQUITO VECTOR POPULATION CONTROL
20              SECTION 5.4. It is the intent of the General Assembly to prevent large populations
21   of floodwater mosquitoes from emerging following Hurricane Florence, as this could adversely
22   impact the public health by hindering the State's response and recovery efforts and increasing the

24   of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, to continue to work with local health
25   departments to expedite mosquito control efforts in counties that are or become part of a disaster
26   declaration by the President of the United States under the Stafford Act (P.L. 93-288) as a result
27   of Hurricane Florence. For purposes of this section, mosquito control efforts include mosquito
28   abatement activities, integrated mosquito management activities, education regarding mosquito
29   bite avoidance, and the purchase and distribution of materials for personal prevention measures.
