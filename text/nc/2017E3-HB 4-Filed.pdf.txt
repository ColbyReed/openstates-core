10
11   DAMAGE CAUSED BY HURRICANE FLORENCE
12               SECTION 2.1.(a) The General Assembly finds that Hurricane Florence was one of
13   the strongest storms to form in the Atlantic Ocean in the history of North Carolina, reaching wind
14   speeds of up to 140 miles an hour and covering 500 miles; making landfall on September 14,
15   2018; causing heavy rainfall, record flooding, high storm surge, and dozens of deaths in the State
16   as of the date of this act; and necessitating the declaration of a State of Emergency for the State
17   by the Governor and a Major Disaster Declaration by the President of the United States for
18   multiple counties in the State.
19               SECTION 2.1.(b) The General Assembly finds that as a result of Hurricane Florence
20   the following has occurred:
21               (1)     Central and southeastern North Carolina suffered significant damage to public
22                       and private property.
23               (2)     Essential utility services and systems and other critical infrastructure have
24                       been seriously disrupted.
25               (3)     Over 880,000 people have lost power, thousands of people have been
26                       displaced from their homes, and 1,600 roads have been closed.

 1              (4)     Riverine flooding began at the start of Hurricane Florence, and the effects
 2                      continue to be felt across the State. Several large rivers reached and exceeded
 3                      major flooding levels.
 4              (5)     As of the date of this act, twenty-eight of the State's counties have been
 5                      declared a major disaster by the President of the United States under the
 6                      Stafford Act (P.L. 93-288), with others requested and pending approval.
 7              (6)     North Carolinians have lost their lives, their loved ones, their homes, their
 8                      communities, their schools and houses of worship, their life savings, their
 9                      businesses and places of employment, their possessions, their pets, and their
10                      ways of life.
11              (7)     Entire towns throughout eastern North Carolina were flooded to the rooftops
12                      as the record storm surge combined with water levels of rivers and streams
13                      crested at flood-stage heights far beyond those ever seen before in this State.
14              (8)     Thirty-four states assisted North Carolina in addressing the devastation caused
15                      by Hurricane Florence.
16              (9)     Thousands of emergency responders, National Guard members, and other
17                      volunteers worked to respond and assist disaster areas during and after the
18                      time the storm made landfall.
19              (10)    Swift action by the General Assembly is necessary to provide relief to and
20                      facilitate recovery efforts for the citizens of North Carolina devastated from
21                      the Hurricane.
22              (11)    Assessments from the damages resulting from Hurricane Florence are
23                      ongoing, and Public Assistance projects are in planning stages to repair
24                      facilities and roads, remove debris, and otherwise effectuate cleanup and
25                      repair.
26              (12)    Further assistance by the General Assembly will be needed on behalf of the
27                      people and local governments who have suffered damage to public buildings,
28                      roads, wastewater treatment plants, and other critical infrastructure.

44   encumbrance, or disbursed shall remain available to implement the provisions of this act and
45   subsequent acts necessitated as a result of Hurricane Florence until the General Assembly directs
46   the reversion of the unexpended funds. Funds received by a State agency from the Fund that are
47   not expended, made subject to an encumbrance, or disbursed to another entity at the end of each
48   fiscal year shall revert to the Fund. Funds received by a non-State entity from the Fund that, after
49   three years, are not expended, made subject to an encumbrance, or disbursed to a subgrantee shall
50   be returned to the Fund.

28   MOSQUITO VECTOR POPULATION CONTROL
29              SECTION 5.4. It is the intent of the General Assembly to prevent large populations
30   of floodwater mosquitoes from emerging following Hurricane Florence, as this could adversely
31   impact the public health by hindering the State's response and recovery efforts and increasing the
32   number of vector-borne illnesses. To that end, the General Assembly encourages the Department
33   of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, to continue to work with local health
34   departments to expedite mosquito control efforts in counties that are or become part of a disaster
35   declaration by the President of the United States under the Stafford Act (P.L. 93-288) as a result
36   of Hurricane Florence. For purposes of this section, mosquito control efforts include mosquito
37   abatement activities, integrated mosquito management activities, education regarding mosquito
