The local charge that is required to be collected by a seller and any amounts unreturned to the prepaid consumer of mobile telephony services that are not owed as part of the local charge, but that were collected from the prepaid consumer under the representation by the seller that they were owed as part of the local charge, constitute debts owed by the seller jointly to the state, for purposes of collection on behalf of, and payment to, the local jurisdiction and to the local jurisdiction imposing that local charge.(k) A seller that has collected any amount of prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges in excess of the amount of the surcharge imposed by this part and actually due from a prepaid consumer may refund that amount to the prepaid consumer, even though the surcharge amount has already

      department shall be a debt owed to the state by the person required to collect and remit the surcharge. Any local charge collected from a prepaid consumer that has not been remitted to the board department
      shall be a debt owed jointly to the state, for purposes of collection on behalf of, and payment to, the local jurisdiction and to the local jurisdiction imposing the local charge by the person required to collect and remit the local charge.

The credit shall be apportioned to the charges against which it is allowed in
      proportion to the amounts of those charges.(m) (1) A seller is relieved from liability to collect the prepaid MTS surcharge imposed by this part that became due and payable, insofar as the base upon which the surcharge is imposed is represented by accounts that have been found to be worthless and charged off for income tax purposes by the seller or, if the seller is not required to file income tax returns, charged off in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A seller that has previously paid the surcharge may, under rules and regulations prescribed by the board, department, take as a deduction on its return the amount found worthless and charged off by the seller. If any such accounts are thereafter in whole or in
      part collected by the seller, the amount so collected shall be included in the first return filed after such collection and the surcharge shall be paid with the return.(2) The board department may by regulation promulgate such other rules with respect to uncollected or worthless accounts as it shall deem necessary to the fair and efficient administration of this part.SEC. 331.

      postal ZIP Code of the prepaid consumer’s address that the seller uses corresponds to more than one local charge.SEC. 332.

Section 42100 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:42100. (a) This part shall be known and may be cited as the Local Prepaid Mobile Telephony Services Collection Act.(b) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(1) Maintaining effective and efficient communications services, 911 emergency systems, communications-related public policy programs to promote universal service, and various local programs across the state benefit all persons with access to the telecommunications system.(2) Providers of end-use communications services, including providers of mobile voice telecommunications services, which the Federal Communications Commission terms mobile telephony service, are
      required to collect and remit utility users taxes and local 911 or access charges (local charges) imposed by over 150 cities and counties in California on end-users of such mobile telephony services, as required by existing state or local law.(3) Local charges on telecommunication services represent an important source of tax revenue for many cities and counties and are used to pay for such essential governmental services as public safety, streets, parks, libraries, senior centers, and many more.(4) Prepaid mobile telephony services are an important and growing segment of the communications industry. Prepaid mobile telephony services, unlike postpaid mobile telephony services, are frequently sold by a third-party seller that is not the provider of mobile telephony services, and collecting local charges from prepaid consumers of mobile telephony services at the time of the retail
      transaction is necessary and the most efficient and competitively neutral means for the collection of those local charges.(5) The collection of prepaid mobile telephony services by third-party sellers and the remittance of those local charges to the board department involves administrative costs and responsibilities that are unique to prepaid mobile telephony services, and therefore justify unique reimbursement and tax rate simplification measures, which are fair and reasonable.(c) It is a matter of statewide concern that the local charges for local prepaid mobile telephony services be collected in a uniform manner in order for the collection to be fair and uniform on a statewide basis.(d) It is the intention of the Legislature that this part shall preempt the provisions pertaining to the tax or charge rate, base, and method of collection contained in all local ordinances, rules, or regulations concerning the imposition of a local charge upon the consumption of prepaid mobile telephony services to the extent those provisions are inconsistent with the provisions of this part and Part 21 (commencing with Section 42001).

      requirements of Sections 7284.6, 7284.7, and 19542, the board
      department shall make available to a requesting local jurisdiction or local agency any information that is reasonably available to the board department regarding the proper collection and remittance of a local charge of the local jurisdiction or local agency by a seller, including a direct seller.(f) The board department may contract with a third party for purposes of this part, solely in connection with the following board
      department duties:(1) To allocate and transmit collected local charges in the Local Charges for Prepaid Mobile Telephony Services Fund pursuant to subdivision (b) to the appropriate local jurisdictions.(2) To audit proper collection and remittance of the local charge pursuant to this part.(3) To respond to requests from sellers, consumers, boards, and others regarding issues pertaining to local charges that are within the scope of the board’s department’s duties.(g) For purposes of this part, any third-party contract under

Section 42105 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:42105.
