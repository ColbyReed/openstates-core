The people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(a) Commute patterns throughout northern California, and in particular through the Altamont Pass Corridor, traverse the boundaries of traditional metropolitan planning agencies. The Altamont Pass Corridor, located in the center of the Northern California Megaregion, connects the San Joaquin Valley to the Tri-Valley and is a vital node in the megaregion’s economic ecosystem as well as a key megaregion transportation route. Strategic and planned interregional mobility throughout the Altamont Pass Corridor is essential to sustained economic vitality in the megaregion.(b) The Interstate 580 freeway serves the Altamont Pass Corridor and ranks as one of the most congested freeways in the megaregion during peak hours due to a high volume of regional and interregional commuter, freight, and recreational traffic. It is estimated that traffic on portions of Interstate 580 in this corridor will increase by up to 60 percent between 2013 and 2040.(c) Connecting the Bay Area Rapid Transit District’s rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express, and providing expanded passenger rail connectivity between the San Joaquin Valley and the Bay Area, as recommended by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission’s regional rail plan, would increase interregional mobility and provide much-needed highway capacity for expanded goods movement to the Bay Area’s five
    seaports and the inland Port of Stockton. It would also relieve pressure on Interstate 580 and other transportation systems, given the large exponential population growth in the San Joaquin Valley.(d) The Department of Finance projects that San Joaquin County, along with other counties in the San Joaquin Valley, will be among the fastest growing counties in the state. Between 1990 and 2013, the number of people commuting daily from the northern San Joaquin Valley to the Bay Area more than doubled, growing from 32,000 to nearly 65,000 commuters. This trend is expected to continue with the San Joaquin Valley’s rapid population growth combined with the increasing high housing costs and strong job growth in the Bay Area.(e) Because transportation is the major contributor to ozone precursors,
    increasing auto travel threatens improvement in air quality throughout the megaregion. Growing congestion will add to potential problems because of increased emissions of vehicles operating in stop-and-go traffic. Shifting commuters and other travelers to rail transportation between the San Joaquin Valley and the Bay Area is highly desirable as a means to partially offset the effects on air quality produced by the growth in auto travel.(f) Taxpayers in Alameda County have voted to tax themselves to achieve expanded transit services to the Tri-Valley region.(g) The State of California supports enhanced public transit services that improve
    connectivity between transit operators and provide seamless and convenient travel for public transit passengers.SEC. 2. It is the intent of the Legislature to establish the Tri-Valley-San Joaquin Valley Regional Rail Authority to plan and help deliver a cost-effective connection from the San Joaquin Valley to the Bay Area Rapid Transit District’s rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express in the Tri-Valley, to address regional economic and transportation challenges.SEC. 3. Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 132651) is added to Division 12.7 of the Public Utilities Code, to read:
        CHAPTER
        8.  Tri-Valley-San Joaquin Valley Regional Rail Authority132651. As used in this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings:(a) “Authority” means the Tri-Valley-San Joaquin Valley Regional Rail Authority created under this chapter.(b) “Bay Area Rapid Transit” (BART) means the Bay Area Rapid Transit
        District.(c) “Board” means the governing board of the authority.(d) “Connectivity” means one or more projects necessary to achieve transit connectivity between BART’s rapid transit system and the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission’s Altamont Corridor Express commuter rail service, and to provide quality, seamless service to riders using the services operating between the Tri-Valley and the
        San Joaquin Valley.(e) “Tri-Valley” means the Cities of Danville, Dublin, Livermore, Pleasanton, and San Ramon.132652. The authority is hereby established for purposes of planning, developing, and delivering cost-effective and responsive transit connectivity, between BART’s rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express commuter rail service in the Tri-Valley region of California, that reflects regional consensus and meets the goals and objectives of the
        San Joaquin Valley and Tri-Valley communities, consistent with the project feasibility report adopted pursuant to Section 132661.132655.

        may select the Livermore Amador Valley Transit Authority or the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission to provide administrative support, or may alternatively hire an executive director for those functions. If an executive director is hired, the executive may appoint staff or retain consultants as necessary to carry out the duties of the authority.132658. (a) The unencumbered balance of all local funds programmed for the completion of the BART Livermore extension or that have otherwise been identified for the connectivity shall be transferred to the authority and be considered resources available to effectuate the authority’s purposes pursuant to this chapter, except that local funds controlled by the Alameda County Transportation Commission to
        be used for completion of the BART Livermore extension or that have otherwise been identified for the connectivity shall continue to be programmed and allocated by the Alameda County Transportation Commission pursuant to measures approved by the voters of Alameda County pursuant to Division 19 (commencing with Section 180000).(b) The unencumbered balance of all local funds programmed for the completion of the BART Livermore extension shall be transferred to the authority and be considered resources available to effectuate the authority’s purposes pursuant to this chapter, except that local funds controlled by the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission that have otherwise been identified for connectivity shall continue to be programmed and allocated by the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission pursuant to measures approved by the voters of

        to achieve connectivity except that the authority shall not apply for funds available under the Transportation Development Act (Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 99200) of Part 11 of Division 10) for which any member entity of the authority may also be an applicant or for which any member entity of the authority is charged with approving applications for funding under that act, without the express written consent of that affected member entity.132659. (a) The authority may enter into agreements with the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission, or any other entity to address any and all issues necessary to achieve transit connectivity, consistent with the project feasibility report’s findings, conclusions, and recommendations adopted pursuant to Section 132661.(b) If the project feasibility report includes a recommendation for an extension of BART’s rapid transit system, the governing board of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District shall have the authority to approve or deny the recommendation.(c) If the project feasibility report includes a recommendation for an extension of the Altamont
        Corridor Express commuter rail service, the governing board of the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission shall have the authority to approve or deny the recommendation.132660.
