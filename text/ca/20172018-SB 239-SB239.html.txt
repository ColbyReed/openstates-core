The people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 1603.3 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:1603.3. (a) Before donation of blood or blood components, a donor shall be notified in writing of, and shall have signed a written statement confirming the notification of, all of the following:(1) That the blood or blood components shall be tested for evidence of antibodies to HIV.(2) That the donor shall be notified of the test results in accordance with the requirements described in subdivision (c).(3) That the donor blood or blood component that is found to have the antibodies shall not be used for transfusion.(4) That blood or blood components shall not be donated for transfusion purposes by a person if the person may have reason to believe that he or she has been exposed to HIV or AIDS.(5) That the donor is required to complete a health screening questionnaire to assist in the determination as to whether he or she may have been exposed to HIV or AIDS.(b) A blood bank or plasma center shall incorporate voluntary means of self-deferral for donors. The means of self-deferral may include, but are not limited to, a form with checkoff boxes specifying that the blood or blood components are for research or test purposes only and a telephone callback system for donors to use in order to inform the blood bank or plasma center that blood or
      blood components donated should not be used for transfusion. The blood bank or plasma center shall inform the donor, in a manner that is understandable to the donor, that the self-deferral process is available and should be used if the donor has reason to believe that he or she is infected with HIV.(c) Blood or blood components from any donor initially found to have serologic evidence of antibodies to HIV shall be retested for confirmation. Only if a further test confirms the conclusion of the earlier test shall the donor be notified of a reactive result by the blood bank or plasma center.The department shall develop permissive guidelines for blood banks and plasma centers on the method to be used to notify a donor of a test result.(d) Each blood bank or plasma center operating in California shall prominently display at each of its collection sites a notice that provides the addresses and telephone numbers of sites, within the proximate area of the blood bank or plasma center, where anonymous HIV antibody testing provided pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 120885) of Part 4 of Division 105 may be administered without charge.(e) The department may promulgate any additional regulations it deems necessary to enhance the safety of donated blood and blood components. The department may also promulgate regulations it deems necessary to safeguard the consistency and accuracy of HIV test results by requiring any confirmatory testing the department deems appropriate for the particular types of HIV tests that have yielded “reactive,” “positive,”
      “indeterminate,” or other similarly labeled results.(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, civil liability or criminal sanction shall not be imposed for disclosure of test results to a local health officer if the disclosure is necessary to
      locate and notify a blood or blood components donor of a reactive result if reasonable efforts by the blood bank or plasma center to locate the donor have failed. Upon completion of the local health officer’s efforts to locate and notify a blood or blood components donor of a reactive result, all records obtained from the blood bank or plasma center pursuant to this subdivision, or maintained pursuant to this subdivision, including, but not limited to, any individual identifying information or test results, shall be expunged by the local health officer.SEC. 2. Section 1621.5 of the Health and Safety Code is repealed.SEC. 3. Section 1644.5 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:1644.5. (a) Except as provided in subdivision (c) or (d), tissues shall not be transferred into the body of another person by means of transplantation, unless the donor of the tissues has been screened and found nonreactive by laboratory tests for evidence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), agents of viral hepatitis (HBV and HCV), and syphilis. For tissues that are rich in viable leukocytes, the tissue shall be tested for evidence of infection with human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) and found nonreactive. The department may adopt regulations requiring additional
      screening tests of donors of tissues when, in the opinion of the department, the action is necessary for the protection of the public, donors, or recipients.(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), infectious disease screening of blood and blood products shall be carried out solely in accordance with Article 2 (commencing with Section 1602.5) of Chapter 4.(c) All donors of sperm shall be screened and found nonreactive as required under subdivision (a), except in the following instances:(1) A recipient of sperm, from a sperm donor known to the recipient, may waive a second or other repeat testing of that donor if the recipient is informed of the requirements for testing donors under this section and signs a written
      waiver.(2) A recipient of sperm may consent to therapeutic insemination of sperm or use of sperm in other assisted reproductive technologies even if the sperm donor is found reactive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, HIV, or HTLV if the sperm donor is the spouse of, partner of, or designated donor for that recipient. The physician providing insemination or assisted reproductive technology services shall advise the donor and recipient of the potential medical risks associated with receiving sperm from a reactive donor. The donor and the recipient shall sign a document affirming that each person comprehends the potential medical risks of using sperm from a reactive donor for the proposed procedure and that each consents to it. Copies of the document shall be placed in the medical records of the donor and the recipient.(3) (A) Sperm whose donor has tested reactive for syphilis may be used for the purposes of insemination or assisted reproductive technology only after the donor has been treated for syphilis. Sperm whose donor has tested reactive for hepatitis B may be used for the purposes of insemination or assisted reproductive technology only after the recipient has been vaccinated against hepatitis B.(B) (i) Sperm whose donor has tested reactive for HIV or HTLV may be used for the purposes of insemination or assisted reproductive technology for a recipient testing negative for HIV or HTLV only after the donor’s sperm has been effectively processed to minimize the likelihood of transmission through the sperm for that specific donation and if informed and
      mutual consent has occurred.(ii) The department shall adopt regulations regulating facilities that perform sperm processing, pursuant to this subparagraph, that prescribe standards for the handling and storage of sperm samples of carriers of HIV, HTLV, or any other virus as deemed appropriate by the department. The department may propose to adopt, as initial regulations, the most relevant and up-to-date recommendations published by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Notice of the department’s proposed adoption of the regulations shall be posted on the department’s Internet Web site for at least 45 days. Public comment shall be accepted by the department for at least 30 days after the conclusion of the 45-day posting period. If a member of the public requests a public hearing during the 30-day comment period, the
      hearing shall be held prior to the adoption of the regulations. If no member of the public requests a public hearing, the regulations shall be deemed adopted at the conclusion of the 30-day comment period. Comments received shall be considered prior to the adoption of the final initial regulations. The department may modify any recommendations published by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Adoption of initial regulations by the department pursuant to this subdivision shall not be subject to the rulemaking requirements of Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code and written responses to public comments shall not be required. Updates to the regulations shall be adopted pursuant to the same process. Until the department adopts these regulations, facilities that perform sperm processing pursuant to this section shall follow facility
      and sperm processing recommendations for the reduction of viral transmission developed by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. This section does not prevent the department from monitoring and inspecting facilities that process sperm to ensure adherence to the regulations, or, until regulations are adopted, to the recommendations set forth by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.(iii) Before insemination or other assisted reproductive technology services are performed, the physician providing the services shall inform the recipient of sperm from a spouse, partner, or designated donor who has tested reactive for HIV or HTLV of all of the following:(I) That sperm processing may not eliminate all of the risks of HIV or HTLV transmission.(II) That the sperm may be tested to determine whether or not it is reactive for HIV or HTLV.(III) That the recipient shall provide documentation to the physician providing insemination or assisted reproductive technology services prior to treatment that she has established an ongoing relationship with another physician to provide for her medical care during and after completion of fertility services.(IV) The most relevant and up-to-date recommendations published by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine regarding followup testing for HIV and HTLV after use of sperm from an HIV or HTLV reactive donor and have the recommendations regarding followup testing be documented in the recipient’s medical
      record.(iv) The physician providing insemination or assisted reproductive technology services shall also verify, and document in the recipient’s medical record, that the donor of sperm who tests reactive for HIV or HTLV is under the care of a physician managing the HIV or HTLV.(v) The physician providing insemination or assisted reproductive technology services shall recommend to the physician who will be providing ongoing care to the recipient recommended followup testing for HIV and HTLV according to the most relevant and up-to-date guidelines published by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, which shall be documented in the recipient’s medical record.(vi) If the recipient becomes HIV or HTLV positive,
      the physician assuming ongoing care of the recipient shall treat or provide information regarding referral to a physician who can provide ongoing treatment of the HIV or HTLV.(4) A recipient of sperm donated by a sexually intimate partner of the recipient for reproductive use may waive a second or repeat testing of that donor if the recipient is informed of the donor testing requirements of this section and signs a written waiver. For purposes of this paragraph, “sexually intimate partner of the recipient” includes a known or designated donor to whose sperm the recipient has previously been exposed in a nonmedical setting in an attempt to conceive.(d) Subdivision (a) does not apply to the transplantation of tissue from a donor who has not been tested or, with the exception of HTLV,
      has been found reactive for the infectious diseases listed in subdivision (a) or for which the department has, by regulation, required additional screening tests, if all of the following conditions are satisfied:(1) The physician and surgeon performing the transplantation has determined any one or more of the following:(A) Without the transplantation the intended recipient will most likely die during the period of time necessary to obtain other tissue or to conduct the required tests.(B) The intended recipient already is diagnosed with the infectious disease for which the donor has tested positive.(C) The symptoms from the infectious disease for which the donor
      has tested positive will most likely not appear during the intended recipient’s likely lifespan after transplantation with the tissue or may be treated prophylactically if they do appear.(2) The physician and surgeon performing the transplantation has ensured that an organ from an individual who has been found reactive for HIV may be transplanted only into an individual who satisfies both of the following:(A) The individual has been found reactive for HIV before receiving the organ.(B) The individual is either participating in clinical research approved by an institutional review board under the criteria, standards, and regulations described in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 274f-5 of Title 42 of the United States Code,
      or, if the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services determines under subsection (c) of Section 274f-5 of Title 42 of the United States Code that participation in this clinical research is no longer warranted as a requirement for transplants, the individual is receiving the transplant under the standards and regulations under subsection (c) of Section 274f-5 of Title 42 of the United States Code.(3) Consent for the use of the tissue has been obtained from the recipient, if possible, or if not possible, from a member of the recipient’s family, or the recipient’s legal guardian. For purposes of this section, “family” means spouse, adult son or daughter, either parent, adult brother or sister, or grandparent.(e) The penalties prescribed in Section 120290 do not apply
      to a sperm donor covered under subdivision (c) or an organ or tissue donor who donates an organ or tissue for transplantation or research purposes.(f) Human breast milk from donors who test reactive for agents of viral hepatitis (HBV and HCV), HTLV, HIV, or syphilis shall not be used for deposit into a milk bank for human ingestion in California.SEC. 4. Section 120290 of the Health and Safety Code is repealed.SEC. 5. Section 120290 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:120290.

A person’s interaction with the defendant is not involuntary solely on the basis of his or her lack of knowledge that the defendant was afflicted with the disease.(2) A defendant is guilty of willful exposure to an infectious or communicable disease if a health officer, or the health officer’s designee, acting under circumstances that make securing a quarantine or health officer order infeasible, has instructed the defendant not to engage in particularized conduct that poses a substantial risk of transmission of an infectious or communicable disease, and the
      defendant engages in that conduct within 96 hours of the instruction. A health officer, or the health officer’s designee, may issue a maximum of two instructions to a defendant that may result in a violation of this paragraph.(b) The defendant does not act with the intent required pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) if the defendant takes, or attempts to take, practical means to prevent transmission.(c) Failure to take practical means to prevent transmission alone is insufficient to prove the intent required pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a).(d) Becoming pregnant while infected with an infectious or communicable disease, continuing a pregnancy while infected
      with an infectious or communicable disease, or declining treatment for an infectious or communicable disease during pregnancy does not constitute a crime for purposes of this section.(e) For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:(1) “Conduct that poses a substantial risk of transmission” means an activity that has a reasonable probability of disease transmission as proven by competent medical or epidemiological evidence. Conduct posing a low or negligible risk of transmission as proven by competent medical or epidemiological evidence does not meet the definition of conduct posing a substantial risk of transmission.(2) “Infectious or communicable disease” means a disease that spreads
      from person to person, directly or indirectly, that has significant public health implications.(3) “Practical means to prevent transmission” means a method, device, behavior, or activity demonstrated scientifically to measurably limit or reduce the risk of transmission of an infectious or communicable disease, including, but not limited to, the use of a condom, barrier protection or prophylactic device, or good faith compliance with a medical treatment regimen for the infectious or communicable disease prescribed by a
      health officer or physician.(f) This section does not preclude a defendant from asserting any common law defense.(g) (1) A
      violation of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) or paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) is a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than six months.(2) A person who attempts to intentionally transmit an infectious
      or communicable disease by engaging in the conduct described in subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (E) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than 90 days.(h) (1) When alleging a violation of subdivision (a), the prosecuting attorney or the grand jury shall substitute a pseudonym for the true name of a complaining witness. The actual name and other identifying characteristics of a complaining
      witness shall be revealed to the court only in camera, unless the complaining witness requests otherwise, and the court shall seal the information from further disclosure, except by counsel as part of discovery.(2) Unless the complaining witness requests otherwise, all court decisions, orders, petitions, and other documents, including motions and papers filed by the parties, shall be worded so as to protect the name or other identifying characteristics of the
      complaining witness from public disclosure.(3) Unless the complaining witness requests otherwise, a court in which a violation of this section is filed shall, at the first opportunity, issue an order that prohibits counsel, their agents, law enforcement personnel, and court staff from making a public disclosure of the name or any other identifying characteristic of the complaining witness.(4) Unless the defendant requests otherwise, a court in which a violation of this section is filed, at the earliest opportunity, shall issue an order that counsel and their agents, law enforcement personnel, and court staff, before a finding of guilt, not publicly disclose the name or other identifying characteristics of the defendant, except by counsel as part of discovery or to a limited number of relevant individuals in its investigation of the specific charges under this section. In any public disclosure, a pseudonym shall be substituted for the true name of the defendant.(5) For purposes of this subdivision, “identifying characteristics” includes, but is not limited to, the name or any part of the name, address or any part of the address,
      city or unincorporated area of residence, age, marital status, relationship of the defendant and complaining witness, place of employment, or race or ethnic background.(i) (1) A court, upon a finding of probable cause that an individual has violated this section, shall order the production of the individual’s medical records or the attendance of a person with relevant knowledge thereof, so long as the return of the medical records or attendance of the person pursuant to the subpoena is submitted initially to the court for an in-camera inspection. Only upon a finding by the court that the medical records or proffered testimony are
      relevant to the pleading offense, the information produced pursuant to the court’s order shall be disclosed to the prosecuting entity and admissible if otherwise permitted by law.(2) A defendant’s medical records, medications, prescriptions, or medical devices shall not be used as the sole basis of establishing the specific intent required pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a).(3) Surveillance reports and records maintained by state and local health officials shall not be subpoenaed or released for the purpose of establishing the specific intent required pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a).(4) A court shall take judicial notice of any fact establishing an element of the
      offense upon the defendant’s motion or stipulation.(5) A defendant is not prohibited from submitting medical evidence to show the absence of the stated intent required pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a).(j) Before sentencing, a defendant shall be assessed for placement in one or more community-based programs that provide counseling, supervision, education, and reasonable redress to the victim or victims.(k) (1) This section does not apply to a person who donates an organ or tissue for transplantation or research purposes.(2) This section does not apply to a person, whether a paid or volunteer donor, who donates
      breast milk to a medical center or breast milk bank that receives breast milk for purposes of distribution.SEC. 6. Section 120291 of the Health and Safety Code is repealed.SEC. 7.
