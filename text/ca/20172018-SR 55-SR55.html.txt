WHEREAS, The tragic events that took place on August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia prove that white nationalism and neo-Nazism remain very real threats to our nation’s social and racial progress; andWHEREAS, Throughout the course of our nation’s history, white nationalism has promoted intimidation and violent repression of individuals solely on the basis of their race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and immigration status; andWHEREAS, Today, white nationalism has attempted to reinvent itself, self-identifying as the “Alt-Right,” yet its present-day rhetoric and terrorism conjure painful memories of our nation’s past; andWHEREAS, While free speech is a bedrock value for Americans, white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups promote agendas that are dangerous to public safety and the welfare of our communities because they incite and promote lawless actions and utilize language for the purpose of inciting an immediate breach of the peace by provoking fights and violence; andWHEREAS, White nationalism and neo-Nazism are continuing to grow as menaces to societal order that seek to reignite social animosities, reverse improvements in race relations, divide the nation, and foment hatred, classism, and ethnic eradication; andWHEREAS, The white nationalist and neo-Nazi message of racial and social intolerance has led to senseless acts of violence that continue to terrorize individuals and communities; now, therefore, be itResolved by the Senate of the State of California, That the Senate firmly denounces and opposes the totalitarian impulses, violent terrorism, xenophobic biases, and bigoted ideologies that are promoted by white nationalists and neo-Nazis; and be it furtherResolved, That the Legislature urges state and local law enforcement to use the full extent of the state laws, including, but not limited to, statutes related to terrorism and hate crimes, to prosecute white nationalist and neo-Nazi individuals who come into our communities and commit violent and destructive acts; and be it furtherResolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies of this resolution to the author for appropriate distribution.
