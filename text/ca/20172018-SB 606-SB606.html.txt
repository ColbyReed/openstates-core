Section 10610.2 of the Water Code is amended to read:10610.2. (a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(1) The waters of the state are a limited and renewable resource subject to ever-increasing demands.(2) The conservation and efficient use of urban water supplies are of statewide concern; however, the planning for that use and the implementation of those plans can best be accomplished at the local level.(3) A long-term, reliable supply of water is essential to protect the productivity of California’s businesses and economic climate, and increasing
      long-term water conservation among Californians, improving water use efficiency within the state’s communities and agricultural production, and strengthening local and regional drought planning are critical to California’s resilience to drought and climate change.(4) As part of its long-range planning activities, every urban water supplier should make every effort to ensure the appropriate level of reliability in its water service sufficient to meet the needs of its various categories of customers during normal, dry, and multiple dry water years now and into the foreseeable future, and every urban water supplier should collaborate closely with local land-use authorities to ensure water demand forecasts are consistent with current land-use planning.(5) Public health issues have
      been raised over a number of contaminants that have been identified in certain local and imported water supplies.(6) Implementing effective water management strategies, including groundwater storage projects and recycled water projects, may require specific water quality and salinity targets for meeting groundwater basins water quality objectives and promoting beneficial use of recycled water.(7) Water quality regulations are becoming an increasingly important factor in water agencies’ selection of raw water sources, treatment alternatives, and modifications to existing treatment facilities.(8) Changes in drinking water quality standards may also impact the usefulness of water supplies and may ultimately impact
      supply reliability.(9) The quality of source supplies can have a significant impact on water management strategies and supply reliability.(b) This part is intended to provide assistance to water agencies in carrying out their long-term resource planning responsibilities to ensure adequate water supplies to meet existing and future demands for water.SEC. 19. Section 10610.4 of the Water Code is amended to read:10610.4. The Legislature finds and declares that it is the policy of the state as follows:(a) The management of urban water demands and efficient use of water shall be actively pursued to protect both the people of the state and their water resources.(b) The management of urban water demands and efficient use of urban water supplies shall be a guiding criterion in public decisions.(c) Urban water suppliers shall be required to develop water management plans to achieve the efficient use of available supplies and strengthen local drought
      planning.SEC. 20.

Section 10620 of the Water Code is amended to read:10620. (a) Every urban water supplier shall prepare and adopt an urban water management plan in the manner set forth in Article 3 (commencing with Section 10640).(b) Every person that becomes an urban water supplier shall adopt an urban water management plan within one year after it has become an urban water supplier.(c) An urban water supplier indirectly providing water shall not include planning elements in its water management plan as provided in Article 2 (commencing with Section 10630) that would be applicable to urban water suppliers or public agencies directly providing water, or to
      their customers, without the consent of those suppliers or public agencies.(d) (1) An urban water supplier may satisfy the requirements of this part by participation in areawide, regional, watershed, or basinwide urban water management planning where those plans will reduce preparation costs and contribute to the achievement of conservation, efficient water use, and improved local drought resilience.(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), each urban water supplier shall develop its own water shortage contingency plan, but an urban water supplier may incorporate, collaborate, and otherwise share information with other urban water suppliers or other governing entities participating in an areawide, regional, watershed, or basinwide urban water management plan, an
      agricultural management plan, or groundwater sustainability plan development.(3) Each urban water supplier shall coordinate the preparation of its plan with other appropriate agencies in the area, including other water suppliers that share a common source, water management agencies, and relevant public agencies, to the extent practicable.(e) The urban water supplier may prepare the plan with its own staff, by contract, or in cooperation with other governmental agencies.(f) An urban water supplier shall describe in the plan water management tools and options used by that entity that will maximize resources and minimize the need to import water from other regions.SEC. 25.

This supplement is not an update or an amendment to the plan and, therefore, an urban water supplier is not required to comply with the public notice, hearing, and adoption requirements of Section 10642 before submitting the information to the department.SEC. 26. Section 10630 of the Water Code is amended to read:10630.
