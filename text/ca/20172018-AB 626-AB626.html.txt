The people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. (a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(1) California is the largest agricultural producer and exporter in the United States.(2) California is home to the “farm-to-table” movement, which embraces the idea that restaurants and other food sellers should prioritize locally and sustainably produced foods.(3) Many cities have embraced the idea of locally grown, produced, and prepared foods. Sacramento, for example, proclaimed itself the farm-to-fork capital of America.(4) Accordingly, Californians have shown a preference for supporting local agriculture and local business and for finding sustainable solutions to food insecurity.(5) The retail and commercial food market is an integral part of California’s economy.(6) Small-scale, home-cooking operations can create significant economic opportunities for Californians that need them most — often women, immigrants, and people of color.(7) Under existing law, individuals can sell food through retail food facilities or cottage food operations, the latter of which being limited to a restricted list that primarily consists of nonperishable food items that can be prepared in
    the home. Both of these options make it difficult for the vast majority of home cooks to independently benefit from their labor, skills, and limited resources.(8) Because the bar for entry to restaurant ownership is high, and the cost of renting a retail kitchen is so great, an informal economy of locally produced and prepared hot foods exists in the form of meal preparation services, food carts, and communally shared meals.(9) However, due to a lack of appropriate regulations, many experienced cooks in California are unable to legally participate in the locally prepared food economy and to earn an income legally therein.(10) As a result, and because they feel they have no other option, thousands of private chefs, home
    caterers, and many other food microentrepreneurs cook out of private homes or unlicensed food facilities, with little access to education for best practices or safety guidelines.(11) Many of these cooks are unable to enter the traditional food economy based on disability, family responsibilities, or lack of opportunity.(12) Under existing law, preparing and selling food from a home kitchen normally can be treated as a criminal act and may be punishable as a misdemeanor.(13) Providing guidelines, training, and safety resources to home cooks would also increase public health safeguards in existing informal food economies.(14) The exchange of
    home-cooked food can also improve access to healthy foods for communities, particularly in food deserts with severely limited options.(15) The California Retail Food Code establishes health and sanitation standards for retail food facilities. That law exempts private homes from the definition of a food facility and includes cottage food operations in that exemption.(16) Therefore, the Legislature should create a framework that authorizes the safe preparation and sale of meals prepared in home kitchens, providing adequate regulations and requirements for food handling and safety.(b) It is the intent of the Legislature that this act authorize the use of home kitchens for small-scale, direct food sales by home cooks
    to consumers, providing appropriate flexibility in food types and appropriate health and sanitation standards.SEC. 2. Section 110460 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:110460.
