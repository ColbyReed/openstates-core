To the
Congress of the United States of America:

Your memorialist
respectfully represents:

Whereas, the
growth and abuse of federal regulatory authority threaten our constitutional
liberties, including those guaranteed by the Bill of Rights in the First,
Second, Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the United States Constitution; and

Whereas,
federal regulators must be more accountable to elected representatives of the
people, not immune from such accountability; and

Whereas, the
Declaration of Independence decried the imposition by the central government of
"an absolute tyranny over these states" and a central government that
"erected a multitude of New Offices and sent hither Swarms of Officers to
harass our People and eat out their Substance"; and

Whereas,
states too often find themselves in a similar position today; and

Whereas, the
United States House of Representatives has passed with bipartisan support the
Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act to require that
Congress approve major new federal regulations before they can take effect; and

Whereas,
even if enacted, a law may be repealed or waived by a future Congress and
President; and

Whereas, an
amendment to the United States Constitution does not require the President's
approval and cannot be waived by a future Congress and President.

Wherefore
your memorialist, the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona, the
Senate concurring, prays:

1.  That
the United States Congress vote to propose the Regulation Freedom Amendment to
the United States Constitution as follows:

Whenever
one-quarter of the Members of the United States House or the United States
Senate transmit to the President their written declaration of opposition to a
proposed federal regulation, it shall require a majority vote of the House and
Senate to adopt that regulation.

2.  That
the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial
to each Member of Congress.
