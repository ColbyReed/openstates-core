is amended to read:

START_STATUTE20-359.  Deviations
from filed workers' compensation rates

A.  Every
insurer shall adhere to the filings made by the rating organization of which it
is a member, except that any member insurer may file with the director:

1.  A
uniform percentage decrease or increase in any rate filing to
be applied to the statewide rate portion of the rating
organization's that rate filing.

2.  A
subclassification rate related rule that deviates from the rules or any schedule rating plan filed by the insurer's rating
organization.  An insurer shall not apply a deviation and a schedule
rating plan within the same insurance company rate filing.

B.  Each
deviation filed shall be on file with the director for a waiting period of at
least thirty days before it becomes effective.  On written
application by the insurer making the filing, the director may authorize a
filing to become effective before the waiting period expires.  A deviation that
is filed pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section and that is not
disapproved by the director expires the following December 31 at midnight in
this state unless the director terminates the deviation sooner.  A
deviation that is filed pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section
continues until the insurer withdraws the deviation or the director determines
that the deviation no longer meets the standards prescribed in section 20â€‘356,
paragraph 1.  At any time the director may require an insurer to actuarially
support a deviation.  The insurer that files the deviation shall
simultaneously send a copy of the filing to the rating organization of which it
is a member and to any designated rating organization.

C.  A
rating organization shall notify the director if the organization disapproves
any deviation relating to workers' compensation insurance.  The
director shall notify the industrial commission of the disapproval within ten
days of receipt of the disapproval from the rating organization. END_STATUTE
