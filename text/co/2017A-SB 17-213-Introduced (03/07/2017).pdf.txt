CONCERNING AUTHORIZATION FOR AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEMS TO
CONTROL MOTOR VEHICLES THROUGHOUT COLORADO.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
hereby finds and declares that:
(a) Innovative technology in the form of automated driving
systems can save lives, improve mobility, and foster growth in the
economic vitality of our state;
(b) In 2016, more than 600 people died on Colorado roads and
highways, but because human error contributes to most crashes, the use
of automated driving systems could reduce traffic fatalities by up to 90
percent;
(c) Nationwide, 2016 saw more than 2 million crashes, which has
significant financial consequences;
(d) Automated driving systems provide mobility options for
people who are young, elderly, disabled, poor, or impaired;
(e) Automated driving systems offer a solution for cost-efficient
last-mile connections with existing public transit;
(f) Automated driving systems should create new jobs, job sectors,
and economic models, and the testing and deployment of these
technologies in Colorado will build on Colorado's reputation as a hub for
advanced technologies;
(g) The services being developed on platforms connected to the
this industry will generate investment, jobs, and income across many
sectors of the economy; and
(h) Colorado's best interest is served by expressly authorizing the
use of automated driving systems.
SECTION 2. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 42-1-102, amend the
introductory portion; and add (7.7) as follows:
42-1-102. Definitions. As used in articles 1 to 4 of this title TITLE
42, unless the context otherwise requires:
(7.7)     "AUTOMATED    DRIVING SYSTEM" MEANS TECHNOLOGY
INSTALLED ON A MOTOR VEHICLE THAT HAS THE CAPABILITY TO DRIVE A
MOTOR VEHICLE WITHOUT THE NEED FOR SUPERVISION OR CONTROL BY A
HUMAN DRIVER ON A PART-TIME OR FULL-TIME BASIS.
SECTION 3. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 42-4-110, add (6) as
follows:
42-4-110. Provisions uniform throughout state. (6) (a) THE
GENERAL ASSEMBLY HEREBY FINDS THAT THE USE OF AUTOMATED
DRIVING SYSTEMS WILL HELP PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY
DRIVING, INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO ARE ELDERLY AND PEOPLE WITH
DISABILITIES, GAIN ACCESS TO GOODS AND SERVICES ESSENTIAL TO DAILY
LIFE.   THIS    ACCESS REQUIRES TRAVELING ACROSS AND IN MULTIPLE
JURISDICTIONS.     THEREFORE, THE REGULATION OF AUTOMATED DRIVING
SYSTEMS IS A MATTER OF STATEWIDE CONCERN.
(b) LOCAL       AUTHORITIES SHALL NOT BURDEN, REGULATE, OR
PROHIBIT THE USE OF ANY AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEM OR ANY MOTOR
VEHICLE EQUIPPED WITH AN AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEM.                     THIS
SUBSECTION       (6)   SUPERCEDES ANY AUTHORITY GRANTED TO LOCAL
AUTHORITIES UNDER SECTION 42-4-111.
SECTION 4. In Colorado Revised Statutes, add 42-4-242 as
follows:
42-4-242. Automated driving systems - safe harbor. (1) A
PERSON MAY USE AN AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEM TO DRIVE A MOTOR
VEHICLE OR TO CONTROL A FUNCTION OF A MOTOR VEHICLE IF THE SYSTEM
IS CAPABLE OF COMPLYING WITH EVERY STATE AND FEDERAL LAW THAT
APPLIES TO THE FUNCTION THAT THE SYSTEM IS OPERATING.
(2) ANY PROVISION IN ARTICLES 1 TO 3 OF THIS TITLE 42 AND THIS
ARTICLE 4 THAT BY ITS NATURE REGULATES A HUMAN DRIVER, INCLUDING
SECTION 42-2-101, WHICH REQUIRES THAT A HUMAN DRIVER BE LICENSED,
BUT NOT THE SAFE DRIVING OF A MOTOR VEHICLE, DOES NOT APPLY TO AN
AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEM.
(3) A PERSON WHO IS TESTING AN AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEM
THAT IS NOT CAPABLE OF COMPLYING WITH EVERY STATE AND FEDERAL
LAW THAT APPLIES TO THE FUNCTION THE SYSTEM IS OPERATING SHALL
COORDINATE THE TESTING WITH THE COLORADO STATE PATROL AND THE
COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION.
SECTION 5. Act subject to petition - effective date. This act
takes effect at 12:01 a.m. on the day following the expiration of the
