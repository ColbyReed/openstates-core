THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SECTION.

        (II) (III) At the time of enrollment, each local education provider

postsecondary course in which the student is enrolling, including a
postsecondary course offered as part of a program of off-campus instruction
pursuant to section 23-1-109, C.R.S., does not meet the requirements of this
section. The notice must include information about other postsecondary
courses available to the student pursuant to this section at low or no cost to
