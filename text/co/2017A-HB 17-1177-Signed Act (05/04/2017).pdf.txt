        (b) Hearing on such THE application shall DESCRIBED IN
SUBSECTION (5)(a) OF THIS SECTION MUST be held at the earliest practical
time. Unless the court finds that the denial of the right of inspection was
proper, it shall order the custodian to permit such inspection and shall
award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing applicant
in an amount to be determined by the court; except that no court costs and
attorney fees shall be awarded to a person who has filed a lawsuit against
a state public body or local public body and who applies to the court for an
order pursuant to this-substotiorr(-5-) SUBSECTION (5)(a) OF THIS SECTION for
access to records of the state public body or local public body being sued
if the court finds that the records being sought are related to the pending
litigation and are discoverable pursuant to chapter 4 of the Colorado rules
of civil procedure. In the event the court finds that the denial of the right
of inspection was proper, the court shall award court costs and reasonable
attorney fees to the custodian if the court finds that the action was
frivolous, vexatious, or groundless.
