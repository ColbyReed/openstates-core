  CONCERNING RECOGNITION OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN
VETERANS.

    WHEREAS, The military history of African Americans spans from
the arrival of the first enslaved Africans during the colonial history of the
United States to the present day; and

    WHEREAS, In every war fought by or within the United States,
African Americans have participated, including the Revolutionary War,
the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War, the
Spanish-American War, the Indian War, the World Wars, the Korean
War, the Vietnam War, Desert Storm, and the wars in Afghanistan and
Iraq; and
WHEREAS, Nearly 187,000 African-American soldiers served during
the Civil War, roughly 350,000 African-American soldiers served during
World War I, and another 2.5 million registered to serve during World
War II, with many more African Americans serving in the years since
World War II; and

    WHEREAS, On July 26, 1948, President Harry S. Truman signed
Executive Order 9981, integrating the military and mandating equality of
treatment and opportunity for African-American soldiers; and

   WHEREAS, Desegregation of the military was not complete for
several years, and all-African-American units persisted well into the
Korean War; and

   WHEREAS, The last all-African-American unit was not disbanded
until 1954; and

   WHEREAS, Until the Korean War, African-American veterans were
precluded from direct access to benefits from the Veterans
Administration, which included VA housing loans, employment
assistance, unemployment benefits, and health care; and

   WHEREAS, African Americans continue to serve in the United States
military, providing exemplary service, duty, integrity, dedication, and
commitment to our great nation; and

   WHEREAS, Currently, 12% of the United States Armed Forces are
African American; of those, the majority are African-American women;
now, therefore,
