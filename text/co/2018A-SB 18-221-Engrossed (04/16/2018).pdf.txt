CONCERNING          THE ELECTION OF A COUNTY COMMISSIONER IN A
COUNTY WITH A POPULATION OF LESS THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND
BY THE VOTERS RESIDING IN THE DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE
COMMISSIONER RUNS FOR ELECTION.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
SECTION 1. In Colorado Revised Statutes, add 30-10-306.8 as
follows:
30-10-306.8. Election of commissioners by district. (1) IN ANY
COUNTY HAVING A POPULATION OF LESS THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND, THE
REGISTERED ELECTORS MAY, EITHER BY REFERENDUM OR BY INITIATIVE,
CHANGE     THE   METHOD     OF   ELECTING    THE   BOARD     OF   COUNTY
COMMISSIONERS AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION. IN A COUNTY IN WHICH
COMMISSIONERS ARE ELECTED BY THE VOTERS OF THE WHOLE COUNTY,
THE ELECTORS MAY CHANGE THE METHOD OF ELECTION SO THAT
COMMISSIONERS ARE ELECTED ONLY BY VOTERS RESIDING IN THE DISTRICT
FROM WHICH THE COMMISSIONERS RUN FOR ELECTION. IN A COUNTY IN
WHICH COMMISSIONERS ARE ELECTED ONLY BY VOTERS RESIDING IN THE
DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE COMMISSIONERS RUN FOR ELECTION, THE
ELECTORS MAY CHANGE THE METHOD OF ELECTION SO THAT THE
COMMISSIONERS ARE ELECTED BY THE VOTERS OF THE WHOLE COUNTY.
THE COUNTY CLERK AND RECORDER SHALL MAKE ANY OTHER NECESSARY
PROVISION TO EFFECTUATE THE CHANGE IN METHOD OF ELECTION.
(2) SUBJECT TO REFERRAL AS PROVIDED IN THIS SUBSECTION (2),
A BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS MAY PASS A RESOLUTION CHANGING
THE METHOD OF ELECTING THE COMMISSIONERS AS PROVIDED IN
SUBSECTION (1) OF THIS SECTION. PRIOR TO THE NINETIETH DAY BEFORE
THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION, THE BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
SHALL REQUEST THAT THE COUNTY CLERK AND RECORDER PLACE THE
RESOLUTION ON THE BALLOT FOR REFERRAL TO THE REGISTERED ELECTORS
OF THE COUNTY AT THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION.
(3) IN THE ALTERNATIVE, A PETITION SIGNED BY AT LEAST EIGHT
PERCENT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF QUALIFIED ELECTORS OF A COUNTY
VOTING FOR ALL CANDIDATES FOR THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY OF STATE AT
THE LAST PRECEDING GENERAL ELECTION SHALL BE SUFFICIENT TO PLACE
ON THE BALLOT AT A GENERAL ELECTION THE QUESTION OF WHETHER TO
CHANGE    THE   METHOD   OF   ELECTING   THE   BOARD   OF   COUNTY
COMMISSIONERS AS PROVIDED IN SUBSECTION (1) OF THIS SECTION. IN THE
CASE   OF A PETITION TO CHANGE        THE   METHOD OF ELECTING
COMMISSIONERS, SUCH PETITION SHALL SPECIFY THE METHOD OF ELECTION
ACCORDING TO SUBSECTION (1) OF THIS SECTION. THE PETITION SHALL BE
DELIVERED TO THE COUNTY CLERK AND RECORDER PRIOR TO THE
NINETIETH DAY BEFORE THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION WITH A REQUEST
THAT THE QUESTION BE PLACED ON THE BALLOT FOR REFERRAL TO THE
REGISTERED ELECTORS OF THE COUNTY AT THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION.
(4) IN THE EVENT THAT THE REGISTERED ELECTORS OF A COUNTY
VOTE TO CHANGE THE METHOD OF ELECTION OF THE BOARD OF COUNTY
COMMISSIONERS PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, THE TERMS OF OFFICE OF THE
THREE PRESENTLY ELECTED COMMISSIONERS SHALL NOT BE AFFECTED. AT
THE NEXT ELECTION AT WHICH A COMMISSIONER IS ELECTED, SUCH
COMMISSIONER SHALL BE ELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE METHOD
APPROVED BY THE REGISTERED ELECTORS AND AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED
IN SECTION 1-4-205.
SECTION 2. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 1-4-205, amend
