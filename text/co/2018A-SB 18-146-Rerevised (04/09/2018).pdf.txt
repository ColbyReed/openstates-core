CONCERNING          A REQUIREMENT THAT A FREESTANDING EMERGENCY
DEPARTMENT INFORM A PERSON WHO IS SEEKING MEDICAL
TREATMENT ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE OPTIONS THAT ARE
AVAILABLE TO THE PERSON, AND, IN CONNECTION THEREWITH,
MAKING AN APPROPRIATION.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
hereby finds and declares that:
(a) Colorado struggles to control the cost of health care, which is
consistent with national trends;
(b) The cost of health care benefits, including health insurance
policies and monthly premiums, is directly related to the costs of health
care services, products, and medications used by Colorado residents to
maintain their health, whether addressing acute health needs or managing
chronic health conditions;
(c) The costs of receiving health care services for treating a
specific condition vary significantly based on the setting or facility at
which the health care services are delivered to the patient;
(d) Emergency departments, including freestanding emergency
departments, which are often referred to as "FSEDs", have been widely
recognized as the most expensive setting for receiving nonemergency
health care services, and evidence shows that utilization of FSEDs for
nonemergency health care services significantly drives up health care
costs for Colorado residents;
(e) Data from the all payer claims database indicate that seven of
the top ten reasons for visiting a FSED were for nonemergency services;
(f) FSEDs have proliferated, primarily along the Front Range,
with thirty-seven FSEDs in operation in 2016, and Colorado is one of the
top three states in terms of the number of FSEDs operating in the state;
(g) Colorado health care providers, facilities, and insurers have a
shared responsibility to inform and educate Colorado health care
consumers regarding their health care options and costs associated with
those options so that consumers can make informed health care decisions
regarding where they choose to receive their health care, what the costs
will be, and the costs for which they will be responsible;
(h) While initially introduced in Colorado as facilities necessary
to address critical health care coverage gaps existing across diverse
geographic regions, particularly rural regions, FSEDs are increasingly
located in more suburban and urban areas with adequate access to health
care facilities;
(i) Significant differences also exist in terms of the costs patients
incur for receiving nonemergency health care services at FSEDs
compared to receiving similar care at urgent care centers or a primary care
physician's office;
(j)   FSED facility fees significantly increase patients' costs
compared to costs associated with receiving nonemergency care at an
urgent care center or primary care physician's office;
(k) The price of hospital facility fees rose eighty-nine percent
between 2009 and 2015, twice as much as the price of outpatient health
care and four times as much as overall health care spending; and
(l) The intent of this bill is to:
(I) Require transparency and disclosure to consumers by FSEDs
or off-campus emergency departments for the purpose of helping health
care consumers make informed decisions; and
(II) Authorize the Colorado department of public health and
environment to oversee and enforce a comprehensive set of consumer
protections through the implementation of transparency and disclosure
measures.

follows:
