  CONCERNING THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
CAPTURE OF THE U.S.S. PUEBLO BY NORTH KOREA.

   WHEREAS, The U.S.S. Pueblo was originally launched as a United
States Army cargo ship in 1944 but was transferred to the United States
Navy and renamed the U.S.S. Pueblo in 1966; and

    WHEREAS, The U.S.S. Pueblo was named for the city of Pueblo,
Colorado, and the county of Pueblo, Colorado, and was the third ship in
the naval fleet to bear the name Pueblo; and

    WHEREAS, After leaving Japan in early January 1968 on an
intelligence mission, the U.S.S. Pueblo was attacked by the North Korean
military on January 23, 1968; and
WHEREAS, According to United States Naval authorities and the crew
of the U.S.S. Pueblo, the ship was in international waters at the time of
the attack; and

   WHEREAS, One crew member of the U.S.S. Pueblo was killed during
the attack, and eighty crew members and two civilian oceanographers
were captured and held for eleven months by the North Korean
government; and

    WHEREAS, This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of North Korea's
attack on the U.S.S. Pueblo and her crew; and

   WHEREAS, The U.S.S. Pueblo is still in commission in the United
States Navy but continues to be held by the North Korean government
and is currently a museum in Pyongyang, North Korea; now, therefore,

  Be It Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Seventy-first
General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate concurring herein:

   (1) That we, the members of the General Assembly, recognize the
bravery and sacrifice of the crew of the U.S.S. Pueblo;

   (2) That we take pride in the fact that the U.S.S. Pueblo bears the
name of a city and a county in Colorado, and, therefore, the citizens of
Colorado should be aware of the incident that occurred with the U.S.S.
Pueblo fifty years ago;

   (3) That we continue the call for Kim Jong Un and the North Korean
government to return the U.S.S. Pueblo to the people of the United States;
and

   (4) That we hereby designate January 23 each year as "U.S.S. Pueblo
Day" as a day to remember and honor the brave crew of the U.S.S.
Pueblo.
