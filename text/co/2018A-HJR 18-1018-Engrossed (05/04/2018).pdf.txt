CONCERNING HONORING GOLD STAR FAMILIES.
WHEREAS, Since the Revolutionary War, more than one million
American soldiers have died in battle and military conflicts; their
families, who have endured these losses and the accompanying grief, are
known as Gold Star Families; and
WHEREAS, Named for the practice of families hanging service
banners in the windows of their homes with a star for each family
member in the Armed Forces, deep blue stars were displayed for each
living member serving, and they were replaced with gold if their loved
one lost his or her life serving our country and protecting our freedom;
and
WHEREAS, Grace Darling Siebold founded the American Gold
Star Mothers in 1928; her son, George, was serving in World War I, and,
while he was abroad, she channeled her worry into visiting hospitalized
veterans; when the letters from her son stopped arriving and she learned
of his death, she took action in her grief and with a group of mothers
established American Gold Star Mothers, Inc.; and
WHEREAS, Since 1936, Gold Star Mother's Day has been
honored, through presidential proclamation, as the last Sunday of each
September; and
WHEREAS, The acts of heroism and the stories of courage of
each fallen soldier are forever remembered in the minds and hearts of
their families; and
WHEREAS, While national monuments and memorials serve as
strong visible reminders for the men and women who made the ultimate
sacrifice in service to our nation, Gold Star Families are a living legacy
of each fallen soldier and can help us all remember and honor these
heroes by name; and
WHEREAS, Long after the battles have ended, as our stars and
stripes of liberty fly, the families who have at home a folded flag and an
empty seat at the table deserve our respect and our support; now,
therefore,
Be It Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Seventy-first
General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate concurring herein:
That we, the members of the Colorado General Assembly, honor
the pride and the pain of the parents and partners and children and
siblings of our fallen heroes and recognize the families of these proud
patriots with an expression of profound gratitude and respect.
Be It Further Resolved, That copies of this Joint Resolution be sent
to the commanders of the American Legion Posts in Colorado; the
commanders of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Posts in Colorado; the
commanders of Colorado's active military bases; the Pikes Peak Chapter
of Gold Star Mothers; the Denver Chapter of Gold Star Wives; and the
chapters of the Blue Star Mothers of Colorado.
