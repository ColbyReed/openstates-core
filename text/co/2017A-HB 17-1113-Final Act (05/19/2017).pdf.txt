     HOUSE BILL 17-1113


     BY REPRESENTATIVE(S) Willett and Arndt, Buckner, Exum, Lee,
     Lundeen, Pettersen, Young, Herod, Hooton, Humphrey, Lontine,
     Rosenthal, Duran;
     also SENATOR(S) Scott, Kerr.


     CONCERNING ELECTRONIC PARTICIPATION IN COMMITTEE MEETINGS DURING
          THE LEGISLATIVE INTERIM.



     Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:

           SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
     hereby finds and declares that:

             (a) Electronic participation in committee meetings by members of
     the general assembly is currently prohibited, but that general prohibition
     fails to account for technological advances or the reality that Colorado's
     part-time legislature presents significant year-round demands on members
     fulfilling various legislative obligations;

            (b) Modern technology facilitates a verisimilitude of in-person
     interaction, which technology Colorado has already successfully deployed
     to permit remote testimony by the public at committee meetings;


     ________
     Capital letters indicate new material added to existing statutes; dashes through words indicate
     deletions from existing statutes and such material not part of act.
      (c) Rather than enshrine in black-letter law exhaustive criteria to
govern and circumscribe the use of electronic participation, the general
assembly entrusts the executive committee of the legislative council to
monitor members' electronic participation, if any is allowed, and to develop
and occasionally revisit policies so as to:

       (I) Attain the equitable, secure, and orderly use of electronic
participation, including whether it is feasible and desirable to allow
electronically participating members to vote on matters before the
committee or whether such members shall be counted for attendance
purposes but prohibited from voting; and

       (II) Ensure the access to, and quality of, legislative proceedings for
the public, especially inasmuch as the proceedings may incorporate visual
technology that allows electronically participating members to see and be
seen; and

        (d) The general assembly therefore intends to enable the executive
committee of the legislative council to allow, in its discretion, electronic
participation in committee meetings during the legislative interim by
legislators in a manner that provides maximum flexibility for current and
future legislative leaders to implement, regulate, and refine the parameters
governing electronic participation.

       (2) The general assembly further finds that a legislator participating
electronically is still entitled to compensation for attending the meeting, but
not for reimbursement of expenses.

      SECTION 2. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 2-3-303, add (2)(h) as
follows:

        2-3-303. Functions - report - definitions. (2) In addition to any
other powers and duties set forth in law, the executive committee of the
legislative council has the following powers and duties:

       (h) (I) THE POWER TO ALLOW MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
TO PARTICIPATE ELECTRONICALLY IN COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND TO
RECOMMEND AND DEVELOP POLICIES REGARDING ELECTRONIC
PARTICIPATION IF SO ALLOWED; EXCEPT THAT, IF ALLOWED, ELECTRONIC
PARTICIPATION MUST ONLY BE ALLOWED FOR COMMITTEE MEETINGS


PAGE 2-HOUSE BILL 17-1113
OCCURRING DURING THE LEGISLATIVE INTERIM.

      (II) A MEMBER PARTICIPATING ELECTRONICALLY IN A COMMITTEE
MEETING PURSUANT TO THIS SUBSECTION (2)(h) IS DEEMED TO BE IN
ATTENDANCE OF THAT COMMITTEE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING
COMPENSATION TO WHICH THE MEMBER IS ENTITLED UNDER SECTION
2-2-307 (3). NOTWITHSTANDING SECTION 2-2-307 (3)(b), MEMBERS
PARTICIPATING ELECTRONICALLY ARE NOT ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT
FOR ANY EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ELECTRONIC
PARTICIPATION.

      SECTION 3. Safety clause. The general assembly hereby finds,




PAGE 3-HOUSE BILL 17-1113
determines, and declares that this act is necessary for the immediate
preservation of the public peace, health, and safety.
