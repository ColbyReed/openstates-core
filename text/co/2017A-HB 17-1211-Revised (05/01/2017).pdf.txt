CONCERNING
REGARDING DISCIPLINARY STRATEGIES FOR YOUNG STUDENTS.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
SECTION 1. In Colorado Revised Statutes, add 22-2-143 as
follows:
22-2-143.   Discipline strategies pilot program - created -
reporting - rules - definitions - legislative declaration - repeal.
(1) THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY FINDS THAT:
(a) RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT YOUNG CHILDREN WHO ARE
SUSPENDED OR EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL ARE UP TO TEN TIMES MORE
LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE ACADEMIC FAILURE AND GRADE RETENTION AND
TO HOLD NEGATIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD SCHOOL THAN THOSE CHILDREN
WHO ARE NOT SUSPENDED OR EXPELLED.         YOUNG    CHILDREN WHO ARE
SUSPENDED OR EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO DROP
OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND TO BE INCARCERATED LATER IN LIFE.
(b) LACK OF TRAINING TO DEAL WITH BEHAVIORAL ISSUES IN THE
CLASSROOM CONTRIBUTES TO EDUCATION DISSATISFACTION AND
BURNOUT, WHICH INCREASES THE NUMBER OF EDUCATORS WHO LEAVE THE
PROFESSION. PROVIDING ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND SUPPORT IN DEALING
WITH STUDENT DISCIPLINE ISSUES MAY HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND
SCHOOLS RETAIN EXPERIENCED EDUCATORS.
(c) TO   REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF EXCLUSIONARY DISCIPLINE
AMONG STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE ENROLLED IN PRESCHOOL THROUGH
THIRD GRADE, TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS SHOULD RECEIVE
TRAINING AND SUPPORT IN USING CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE METHODS OF
DISCIPLINE    WITH   YOUNG    STUDENTS   AND   IN   IMPLEMENTING
DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE RESPONSES TO THE BEHAVIORAL ISSUES
OF YOUNG STUDENTS.
