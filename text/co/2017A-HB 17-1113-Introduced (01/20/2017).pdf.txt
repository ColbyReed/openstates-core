CONCERNING ELECTRONIC PARTICIPATION IN COMMITTEE MEETINGS
DURING THE LEGISLATIVE INTERIM.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
hereby finds and declares that:
(a) Electronic participation in committee meetings by members of
the general assembly is currently prohibited, but that general prohibition
fails to account for technological advances or the reality that Colorado's
part-time legislature presents significant year-round demands on members
fulfilling various legislative obligations;
(b) Modern technology facilitates a verisimilitude of in-person
interaction, which technology Colorado has already successfully deployed
to permit remote testimony by the public at committee meetings;
(c) Rather than enshrine in black-letter law exhaustive criteria to
govern and circumscribe the use of electronic participation, the general
assembly entrusts the executive committee of the legislative council to
monitor members' electronic participation, if any is allowed, and to
develop and occasionally revisit policies so as to:
(I) Attain the equitable, secure, and orderly use of electronic
participation; and
(II) Ensure the access to, and quality of, legislative proceedings
for the public, especially inasmuch as the proceedings may incorporate
visual technology that allows electronically participating members to see
and be seen; and
(d) The general assembly therefore intends to enable the executive
committee of the legislative council to allow, in its discretion, electronic
participation in committee meetings during the legislative interim by
legislators in a manner that provides maximum flexibility for current and
future legislative leaders to implement, regulate, and refine the
parameters governing electronic participation.
(2)    The general assembly further finds that a legislator
participating electronically is still entitled to compensation for attending
the meeting, but not for reimbursement of expenses.
SECTION 2. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 2-3-303, add (2)(h)
as follows:
2-3-303. Functions - report - definitions. (2) In addition to any
other powers and duties set forth in law, the executive committee of the
legislative council has the following powers and duties:
(h) (I)   THE   POWER TO ALLOW MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL
ASSEMBLY TO PARTICIPATE ELECTRONICALLY IN COMMITTEE MEETINGS
AND TO RECOMMEND AND DEVELOP POLICIES REGARDING ELECTRONIC
PARTICIPATION IF SO ALLOWED; EXCEPT THAT, IF ALLOWED, ELECTRONIC
PARTICIPATION MUST ONLY BE ALLOWED FOR COMMITTEE MEETINGS
OCCURRING DURING THE LEGISLATIVE INTERIM.
(II) A MEMBER PARTICIPATING ELECTRONICALLY IN A COMMITTEE
MEETING PURSUANT TO THIS SUBSECTION             (2)(h)   MUST BE COUNTED
TOWARD ESTABLISHING A QUORUM FOR ATTENDANCE PURPOSES, BUT NOT
TOWARD ESTABLISHING A QUORUM FOR VOTING PURPOSES. ONLY THOSE
MEMBERS ATTENDING IN PERSON ARE PERMITTED TO VOTE ON ANY
MATTER BEFORE THE COMMITTEE.
(III) A MEMBER PARTICIPATING ELECTRONICALLY IN A COMMITTEE
MEETING PURSUANT TO THIS SUBSECTION            (2)(h)    IS DEEMED TO BE IN
ATTENDANCE OF THAT COMMITTEE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING
COMPENSATION TO WHICH THE MEMBER IS ENTITLED UNDER SECTION
2-2-307 (3). NOTWITHSTANDING         SECTION    2-2-307 (3)(b),   MEMBERS
PARTICIPATING ELECTRONICALLY ARE NOT ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT
FOR ANY EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ELECTRONIC
PARTICIPATION.
SECTION 3. Safety clause. The general assembly hereby finds,
determines, and declares that this act is necessary for the immediate
preservation of the public peace, health, and safety.
