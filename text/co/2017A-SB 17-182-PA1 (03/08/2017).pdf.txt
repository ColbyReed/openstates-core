CONCERNING A LIMITATION ON THE OBLIGATION TO COVER DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF A MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT WHEN UNINSURED
MOTORIST INSURANCE MAY COVER THE SAME DAMAGES.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
SECTION 1. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 10-4-609, amend
(1)(c), (2), and (4); and add (5.5) and (8) as follows:
10-4-609. Insurance protection against uninsured motorists -
applicability. (1) (c) The coverage described in paragraph (a) of this
subsection (1) SUBSECTION (1)(a) OF THIS SECTION shall be in addition to
any legal liability coverage and shall cover the difference, if any, between
the amount of the limits of any legal liability coverage and the amount of
the damages sustained, excluding exemplary damages, up to the
maximum amount of the coverage obtained pursuant to this section. A
single policy or endorsement for uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle
coverage issued for a single premium covering multiple vehicles may be
limited to applying once per accident. The amount of the coverage
available pursuant to this section shall not be reduced by a setoff from any
other coverage, including but not limited to, legal liability insurance,
medical payments coverage, health insurance, or other uninsured or
underinsured motor vehicle insurance; EXCEPT THAT INSURERS ARE NOT
REQUIRED TO PAY DAMAGES OR BENEFITS UNDER COVERAGE AVAILABLE
UNDER THIS SECTION AND BENEFITS PAID UNDER ANY TYPE OF MEDICAL
COVERAGE THAT TOGETHER EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF THE INSURED'S
INJURY OR LOSS FOR ANY ONE ACCIDENT CAUSING DAMAGE.
(2) (a) Before the policy is issued or renewed, the insurer shall
offer the named insured the right to obtain uninsured motorist coverage
in an amount equal to the insured's bodily injury liability limits, but in no
event shall the insurer be required to offer limits higher than the insured's
bodily injury liability limits. A POLICY MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT
PROHIBIT STACKING THE LIMITS OF MORE THAN ONE UNINSURED MOTORIST
COVERAGE POLICY AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION IF THE PROVISIONS ARE
INCLUDED IN A SINGLE POLICY COVERING MULTIPLE VEHICLES OR IN
MULTIPLE POLICIES ISSUED BY ONE INSURER, OR BY AFFILIATED INSURERS
THAT ARE UNDER COMMON OWNERSHIP OR MANAGEMENT, TO AN INSURED
OR TO A RESIDENT RELATIVE OF THE INSURED. THESE PROVISIONS MUST
NOT PROHIBIT STACKING OF THE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED PORTIONS
OF A POLICY ISSUED TO AN INSURED AND A SEPARATE POLICY COVERING
THE INSURED THAT WAS NOT ISSUED TO THE INSURED OR A RESIDENT
RELATIVE.
(b)   FOR   PURPOSES OF THIS SUBSECTION         (2),   UNDERINSURED
MOTORIST COVERAGE IS INCLUDED IN THE TERM "UNINSURED MOTORIST
COVERAGE" AS USED IN SUBSECTION (4) OF THIS SECTION.
(4) (a) Uninsured motorist coverage shall MUST include coverage
for damage for bodily injury or death that an insured is legally entitled to
collect from the owner or driver of an underinsured motor vehicle. An
underinsured motor vehicle is a land motor vehicle, the ownership,
maintenance, or use of which is insured or bonded for bodily injury or
death at the time of the accident.
(b) THE LIMITS OF LIABILITY FOR BODILY INJURY OR DEATH UNDER
THE INSURANCE OR BOND REFERENCED IN SUBSECTION                (4)(a)   OF THIS
SECTION ARE EQUAL TO THE LIMITS FOR UNINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE
UNDER THE INSURED'S POLICY AFTER SUBTRACTING ANY PAYMENTS TO
PERSONS OTHER THAN AN INSURED THAT ARE MADE IN CONNECTION WITH
THE ACCIDENT.
(5.5) THE     MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF THE INSURER UNDER THE
UNINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE PROVIDED SHALL BE THE LESSER OF:
(a) THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LIMIT OF UNINSURED MOTORIST
COVERAGE AND THE AMOUNT PAID TO THE INSURED BY OR FOR ANY
PERSON OR ORGANIZATION WHO MAY BE HELD LEGALLY LIABLE FOR THE
BODILY INJURY; OR
(b) THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES SUSTAINED BUT NOT RECOVERED.
(8) AS USED IN THIS SECTION, UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE
REQUIRES:
(a) "UNDERINSURED MOTOR VEHICLE" MEANS A MOTOR VEHICLE,
THE OWNERSHIP, MAINTENANCE, OR USE OF WHICH IS INSURED OR BONDED
FOR BODILY INJURY OR DEATH AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.
(b) "UNINSURED MOTOR VEHICLE" MEANS A MOTOR VEHICLE THAT:
(I) IS NOT INSURED, SELF-INSURED, OR BONDED FOR BODILY INJURY
LIABILITY AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT;
(II) IS INSURED, SELF-INSURED, OR BONDED FOR BODILY INJURY
LIABILITY AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT; EXCEPT THAT THE LIMITS ARE
LESS THAN REQUIRED BY SECTION 10-4-619;
(III) HAS   A POLICY AND THE CARRIER COVERING THE MOTOR
VEHICLE DENIES THAT ITS POLICY PROVIDES LIABILITY COVERAGE FOR
COMPENSATORY DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE ACCIDENT; OR
(IV) HAS    A POLICY AND THE CARRIER COVERING THE MOTOR
VEHICLE IS OR BECOMES INSOLVENT.
SECTION 2. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 10-4-418, add (2)(d)
as follows:
10-4-418. Enforcement procedures - penalties. (2) (d) THE
COMMISSIONER SHALL NOT FIND THAT A POLICY FORM, CERTIFICATE,
CONTRACT OF INSURANCE, OR RIDER DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THIS TITLE
10 ON THE GROUND THAT IT PROHIBITS STACKING THE LIMITS OF MORE
THAN ONE UNINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE POLICY AS PROVIDED IN
SECTION   10-4-609. THE      PROVISIONS TO PREVENT STACKING ARE IN
CONFORMITY WITH THE PUBLIC POLICY OF THIS STATE IF THE PROVISIONS
COMPLY WITH SECTION 10-4-609 (2).
SECTION 3.          Act subject to petition - effective date -
applicability. (1) This act takes effect at 12:01 a.m. on the day following
the expiration of the ninety-day period after final adjournment of the
general assembly (August 9, 2017, if adjournment sine die is on May 10,
2017); except that, if a referendum petition is filed pursuant to section 1
(3) of article V of the state constitution against this act or an item, section,
or part of this act within such period, then the act, item, section, or part
will not take effect unless approved by the people at the general election
to be held in November 2018 and, in such case, will take effect on the
date of the official declaration of the vote thereon by the governor.
(2) This act applies to events causing liability covered by an
uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle insurance policy on or after the
applicable effective date of this act.
