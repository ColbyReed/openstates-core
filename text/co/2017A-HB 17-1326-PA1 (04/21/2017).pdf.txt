CONCERNING          CREATION OF THE JUSTICE REINVESTMENT CRIME
PREVENTION INITIATIVE, AND, IN CONNECTION THEREWITH,
FUNDING THE INITIATIVE THROUGH SAVINGS CREATED BY
PAROLE REFORMS, AND, IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, MAKING
AND REDUCING AN APPROPRIATION.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
finds and declares that:
(a) On any given day, there are over 100,000 Coloradans either
incarcerated or otherwise under some form of criminal justice supervision
at a cost of well over one billion dollars to the state budget annually;
(b) However, many of the neighborhoods that experience higher
crime see little to no reduction in crime overall because public safety
strategies largely react to crime after the fact and fail to adequately
address the root causes of crime;
(c) Law enforcement agencies take their role in helping to
promote public safety very seriously, and they care very deeply about the
communities they serve. However, it is not the role of law enforcement
to address community challenges that impact crime rates such as
unemployment, high school dropout rates, homelessness, or people in
crisis due to mental illness or addiction.
(d) By many metrics, the overuse of the criminal justice system
brings its own set of unintended, negative consequences by damaging
families, straining police and community relations, undermining the
legitimacy of the criminal justice system due to racial disparity,
underserving crime victims, and making it harder for people with a
criminal record to find employment and housing to support their families;
(e) Colorado must develop a new paradigm related to public safety
that is a more comprehensive, community-based approach that focuses on
crime prevention from a community development perspective. This
paradigm combines crime prevention, economic development, mental
health and trauma recovery treatment, improving academic achievement,
strengthening families, and other targeted direct services into our core
public safety strategies. This new paradigm must be based on an
understanding that community development strategies are also important
public safety strategies.
(f) This new public safety paradigm framework is based on
several key components. First, it needs to be geographically targeted to
focus on neighborhoods that have higher rates of crime. Often attempts
at crime prevention have been too dispersed to have the desired impact.
Second, people at the local level are best positioned to identify crime
prevention and community development priorities. Third, in order to
reduce crime rates, multiple strategies must be deployed simultaneously
and in a coordinated fashion. Finally, there must be engagement from the
public sector and the private sector, including business, philanthropy, and
nonprofit organizations.
(g) Justice reinvestment is also an important component of this
new crime prevention framework. Justice reinvestment is an approach
that identifies current ineffective expenditures in criminal justice
spending, reforms those laws and practices, and reinvests the savings into
other public safety strategies. Justice reinvestment has been utilized in
many states across the country, including Colorado.
(2) Therefore, the general assembly determines it is in the best
interest of the state to implement parole reforms to fund a justice
reinvestment crime prevention initiative.
