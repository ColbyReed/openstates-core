CONCERNING ADDING A MEASURE RELATING TO DEMONSTRATION OF
COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS FOR DETERMINING A LOCAL
EDUCATION PROVIDER'S ATTAINMENT OF THE POSTSECONDARY
AND WORKFORCE READINESS PERFORMANCE INDICATOR.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
finds that:
(a) Measures for the postsecondary and workforce readiness
performance indicator were originally adopted as part of the "Education
Accountability Act of 2009", article 11 of title 22. The measures took into
account the data available at the time for determining whether public high
schools, school districts, and the state charter school institute were
successfully graduating students who were prepared for postsecondary
education or to enter the workforce.
(b) Since 2009, the state board of education, as required by
statute, has adopted high school graduation guidelines. School districts
and district and institute charter high schools are required to adopt local
high school graduation requirements that meet or exceed the state
guidelines and implement these requirements beginning in the fall of
2017 for the graduating class of 2021.
(c) The state high school graduation guidelines include a list of
performance demonstrations that high school graduates may complete to
demonstrate that they are academically ready for college and career. Each
school district and each district or institute charter high school must select
from this list those demonstrations that its students must successfully
complete in order to graduate from high school. Thus, the performance
of the school district or charter high school in enabling students to
successfully complete the demonstrations will be reflected in the school
district's and the state charter school institute's overall graduation rate and
in the individual graduation rates of the public schools of the school
district and the institute charter high schools.
(d) Many of the options for demonstrating college and career
readiness, such as successfully completing advanced placement or
international baccalaureate assessments or successfully enrolling in
postsecondary courses through concurrent enrollment, empower students
to demonstrate that they are working toward goals beyond high school
graduation, often leading to higher levels of academic achievement while
they are enrolled in high school and when they subsequently enroll in
postsecondary education;
(e) As adopted by the state board, the standards of achievement
for the college and career readiness demonstrations reflect readiness for
some levels of postsecondary enrollment, but they do not demonstrate that
a student is prepared, without needing remediation, to enroll in the
postsecondary general education core courses in reading, writing, and
mathematics identified pursuant to section 23-1-125 (3);
(f) A student's level of achievement of some of the demonstration
options may be measured objectively by a score. For those demonstration
options, the state board of education should adopt both minimum
achievement standards and higher achievement standards that indicate a
student is prepared, without needing remediation, to enroll in the
postsecondary general education core courses in reading, writing, and
mathematics identified pursuant to section 23-1-125 (3). These higher
achievement standards will enable the state to give a public high school,
a school district, and the state charter school institute additional
performance credit based on the number of high school students who
successfully demonstrate that they are prepared to enroll in these
postsecondary general education courses without need for remediation.
(g)    Enrolling in and receiving college-level credit for the
postsecondary general education core courses in reading, writing, and
mathematics identified pursuant to section 23-1-125 (3) while a student
is in high school also clearly demonstrates that a student is college- and
career-ready before high school graduation. It is appropriate that each
public high school, each school district, and the state charter school
institute receive additional performance credit for the percentage of high
school students who achieve this level of preparation before high school
graduation.
(2) The general assembly finds, therefore, that it is appropriate to
adopt additional measures for the postsecondary and workforce readiness
performance indicator to determine the degree to which public high
schools, school districts, and the state charter school institute enable high
school students to successfully demonstrate that they are ready for college
and career and the extent to which the public high schools, school
districts, and the state charter school institute encourage high school
students to enroll in, and prepare them to successfully complete,
postsecondary core courses in reading, writing, and mathematics.
