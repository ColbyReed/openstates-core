CONCERNING ENERGY STORAGE, AND, IN CONNECTION THEREWITH,
REQUIRING THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO ESTABLISH
MECHANISMS FOR INVESTOR-OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO
PROCURE ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS IF CERTAIN CRITERIA ARE
SATISFIED.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
SECTION 1. Short title. The short title of this act is the "Energy
Storage Procurement Act".
SECTION 2. In Colorado Revised Statutes, add part 2 to article
2 of title 40 as follows:
PART 2
ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS
40-2-201. Legislative declaration. (1) THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
FINDS, DETERMINES, AND DECLARES THAT:
(a)      ENERGY      STORAGE      SYSTEMS   PROVIDE       POTENTIAL
OPPORTUNITIES TO:
(I) REDUCE SYSTEM COSTS;
(II) SUPPORT DIVERSIFICATION OF ENERGY RESOURCES; AND
(III) ENHANCE GRID SAFETY AND RELIABILITY;
(b) FOR THESE REASONS, IT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO EXPLORE
THE USE OF ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS IN COLORADO AND TO INTEGRATE
INTO THE PLANNING PROCESS MECHANISMS FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF
ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS BY COLORADO'S ELECTRIC UTILITIES THROUGH
EVALUATION AND PROCUREMENT METHODOLOGIES.
40-2-202. Definitions. AS      USED IN THIS PART    2,   UNLESS THE
CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES:
(1) "ELECTRIC UTILITY" MEANS AN INVESTOR-OWNED ELECTRIC
UTILITY SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER ARTICLES 1 TO 7 OF THIS TITLE
40.
(2)    "ENERGY    STORAGE SYSTEM" MEANS COMMERCIALLY
AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS CAPABLE OF RETAINING ENERGY,
STORING THE ENERGY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, AND DELIVERING THE
ENERGY AFTER STORAGE BY CHEMICAL, THERMAL, MECHANICAL, OR
OTHER MEANS.
(3)   "PROCURE"   OR   "PROCUREMENT"    MEANS TO ACQUIRE BY
OWNERSHIP OR BY A CONTRACTUAL RIGHT TO USE THE ENERGY FROM, OR
THE CAPACITY OF, AN ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM.
40-2-203.     Procurement mechanisms - determination by
commission - rules. (1)      ON   OR BEFORE   FEBRUARY 1, 2019,   THE
COMMISSION SHALL CONSIDER WHETHER TO ESTABLISH, BY RULE, AS PART
OF THE PLANNING PROCESS, MECHANISMS FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF
ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS BY AN ELECTRIC UTILITY; EXCEPT THAT THESE
MECHANISMS MUST NOT AFFECT ANY OPEN PROCEEDINGS, ONGOING
RESOURCE ACQUISITIONS, OR COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESSES THAT
EXISTED ON FEBRUARY 1, 2018.
(2) IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION REQUIRED BY SUBSECTION (1)
OF THIS SECTION, THE COMMISSION SHALL CONSIDER WHETHER THE
PROCUREMENT OF ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS BY AN ELECTRIC UTILITY
CAN PROVIDE BENEFITS, INCLUDING:
(a) INCREASED INTEGRATION OF ENERGY INTO THE       GRID OF THE
ELECTRIC UTILITY;
(b) IMPROVED RELIABILITY OF THE GRID;
(c) A REDUCTION IN THE NEED FOR THE INCREASED GENERATION
OF ELECTRICITY DURING PERIODS OF PEAK DEMAND; AND
(d) THE AVOIDANCE, REDUCTION, OR DEFERRAL OF INVESTMENT
BY THE ELECTRIC UTILITY.
(3) FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUBSECTION (1) OF THIS SECTION, THE
COMMISSION SHALL ESTABLISH, BY RULE AND PURSUANT TO SECTION
40-2-204,   MECHANISMS FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF ENERGY STORAGE
SYSTEMS IF THE COMMISSION CONCLUDES THAT, IN CONSIDERATION OF ALL
KNOWN AND MEASURABLE BENEFITS AND COSTS, THE BENEFITS TO
CUSTOMERS OF THE ELECTRIC UTILITY ARE LIKELY TO EXCEED THE COSTS
OF THE PROCUREMENT OF ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS.        SUCH BENEFITS
AND COSTS MAY INCLUDE:
(a) A REDUCTION IN THE NEED FOR THE ADDITIONAL GENERATION
OF ELECTRICITY DURING PERIODS OF PEAK DEMAND;
(b) REDUCED GENERATION INTEGRATION COSTS;
(c) AVOIDED OR ADDED COSTS TO THE ELECTRIC UTILITY FOR THE
INTEGRATION OF ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS;
(d) THE BENEFITS ARISING FROM A REDUCTION IN THE EMISSION OF
AIR POLLUTANTS;
(e) THE BENEFITS OF DIVERSIFYING THE TYPES OF RESOURCES USED
FOR THE GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY;
(f) THE     ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCURRED BY THE ELECTRIC
UTILITY; AND
(g) THE COST OF ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS.
40-2-204.     Implementation of procurement mechanisms -
inclusion in planning processes - rules. (1) IF, PURSUANT TO SECTION
40-2-203,   THE COMMISSION DETERMINES THAT IT IS IN THE PUBLIC
INTEREST TO ESTABLISH BY RULE MECHANISMS FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF
ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS BY AN ELECTRIC UTILITY, THE COMMISSION
SHALL ADOPT RULES:
(a) ESTABLISHING    MECHANISMS FOR THE INCLUSION           OF
BENEFITS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS INTO
THE PLANNING CONDUCTED BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES;
(b) REQUIRING     ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO PROVIDE TO THE
COMMISSION APPROPRIATE DATA AND ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL STORAGE
ACQUISITIONS IN THEIR PLANNING PROCESSES, INCLUDING    POTENTIAL
INTERCONNECTION POINTS;
(c) ESTABLISHING    THAT ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS CAN BE
ELIGIBLE FOR UTILITY RATE RECOVERY;
(d) ESTABLISHING THAT AN ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM MAY BE
OWNED BY AN ELECTRIC UTILITY OR BY ANY OTHER PERSON;
(e) (I) ESTABLISHING   REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FILING BY AN
ELECTRIC UTILITY OF ACQUISITION PLANS CONTAINING AN ANALYSIS OF
THE INTEGRATION AND USE OF ELECTRIC STORAGE SYSTEMS.
(II) THE   REQUIREMENTS UNDER THIS SUBSECTION   (1)(e)   MUST
INCLUDE THE REQUIREMENT THAT AN ELECTRIC UTILITY PROVIDE IN ITS
ACQUISITION PLANS:
(A) MODELING ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ASSESS THE COSTS AND
BENEFITS OF ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS; AND
(B) MODEL CONTRACTS FOR PROCUREMENT OF ENERGY STORAGE
SYSTEMS.
(e) REQUIRING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY TO INCLUDE SUCH OTHER
INFORMATION AS THE COMMISSION MAY REQUIRE IN ITS DOCUMENTATION
RELATING TO PLANNING.
(2) ON OR BEFORE MAY 1, 2019, ELECTRIC UTILITIES MAY FILE
APPLICATIONS FOR RATE-BASED PROJECTS, NOT TO EXCEED FIFTEEN
MEGAWATTS OF CAPACITY, FOR ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS.
SECTION 3. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 40-2-101, amend
(3)(b)(I) as follows:
40-2-101.        Creation - appointment - term - subject to
