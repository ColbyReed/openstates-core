CONCERNING TREATMENT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE EXCUSED BY THEIR
PARENTS FROM PARTICIPATING IN STATE ASSESSMENTS.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
SECTION 1. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 22-7-1013, amend
(8)(a) and (8)(b); and add (8)(d) as follows:
22-7-1013. Local education provider - preschool through
elementary and secondary education standards - adoption - academic
acceleration. (8) (a) Each local education provider shall adopt and
implement a written policy and procedure by which a student's parent may
excuse the student from participating in one or more of the state
assessments administered pursuant to section 22-7-1006.3. THE LOCAL
EDUCATION PROVIDER SHALL DETERMINE WHETHER THE PROCESS FOR
EXCUSING A STUDENT REQUIRES A STUDENT'S PARENT TO SUBMIT WRITTEN
NOTICE TO THE LOCAL EDUCATION PROVIDER.
(b) If a parent excuses his or her student from participating in a
state assessment, a local education provider shall not impose negative
consequences, including prohibiting school attendance, imposing an
unexcused absence, or prohibiting participation in extracurricular
activities, on the student or on the parent. IF A PARENT EXCUSES HIS OR
HER STUDENT FROM PARTICIPATING IN A STATE ASSESSMENT, THE LOCAL
EDUCATION PROVIDER SHALL NOT PROHIBIT THE STUDENT FROM
PARTICIPATING IN AN ACTIVITY, OR RECEIVING ANY OTHER FORM OF
REWARD, THAT THE LOCAL EDUCATION PROVIDER PROVIDES TO STUDENTS
FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE STATE ASSESSMENT.
(d) IF   THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OR THE STATE BOARD
RECEIVES A COMPLAINT FROM A PARENT CONCERNING A LOCAL
EDUCATION PROVIDER'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS SUBSECTION (8), THE
DEPARTMENT SHALL NOTIFY THE LOCAL EDUCATION PROVIDER OF THE
NATURE OF THE COMPLAINT.
