CONCERNING             THE    IMPLEMENTATION               OF     EMPLOYMENT             FIRST
ADVISORY PARTNERSHIP RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADVANCE
COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT FOR PERSONS WITH
DISABILITIES, AND, IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, MAKING AN
APPROPRIATION.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
hereby finds and declares that:
(a) Despite having the ability and desire, eighty-five percent of
adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities are either
unemployed or underemployed due to barriers to competitive integrated
employment;
(b) Colorado's low unemployment rate makes it difficult for many
employers to fill staffing needs, and some of these needs could be met
through employing persons with disabilities;
(c) In 2016, Senate Bill 16-077 created the Employment First
Advisory Partnership and charged the members of the partnership with
developing a strategic plan, including relevant policy changes, to expand
competitive integrated outcomes for persons with disabilities;
(d) In its November 2017 preliminary report, the Employment
First Advisory Partnership made several recommendations for working
through public-private partnerships, including creating a Colorado
Business Leadership Network, which utilizes business-to-business
engagement to drive performance outcomes through disability inclusion,
and developing and implementing an outreach program to employers,
educators, case managers, and persons with disabilities and their families
regarding employment first;
(e) Implementing the Employment First Advisory Partnership's
2017 recommendations will benefit persons with disabilities and further
the work of the public-private partnerships, employers, and the state of
Colorado by:
(I) Increasing the number of people entering the workforce who
contribute to Colorado's tax base;
(II)    Increasing the number of persons with disabilities in
competitive integrated employment, thereby reducing dependence on
public assistance programs; and
(III) Increasing the effectiveness of the service systems currently
serving persons with disabilities who are seeking meaningful
employment;
(f) Collecting and reporting disability services and employment
data is necessary to determine progress toward eliminating segregation in
services and increasing the number of persons with disabilities in
competitive integrated employment;
(g) Persons with disabilities and potential employers would
benefit from minimal requirements for basic training or certification in
best practices for supported employment services professionals; and
(h) The discovery process, which is a best-practice assessment
tool for persons with the most significant disabilities should be utilized,
when appropriate, as an alternative to existing assessments provided by
publicly funded employment services for persons with disabilities.
(2) Therefore, the General Assembly declares that implementing
recommendations of the Employment First Advisory Partnership relating
to data collection; training for supported employment professionals;
appropriate use of the discovery process as an assessment for persons
with disabilities; and training and outreach for employers, educators, case
managers, and persons with disabilities and their families in employment
first opportunities and best practices is necessary to increase opportunities
for persons with disabilities and to build on the progress made through
employment first initiatives.
