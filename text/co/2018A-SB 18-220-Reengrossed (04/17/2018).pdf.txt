CONCERNING A PROHIBITION ON SANCTUARY POLICIES.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
SECTION 1. Short title. The short title of this act is the "Public
Safety Protection Against Sanctuary Policies Act".
SECTION 2. In Colorado Revised Statutes, add part 21 to article
33.5 of title 24 as follows:
PART 21
PROHIBITION ON SANCTUARY POLICIES
24-33.5-2101.      Legislative declaration. (1)       THE   GENERAL
ASSEMBLY FINDS AND DECLARES THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE
CONSISTENCY AND FAIRNESS IN THE APPLICATION OF THIS PART                   21
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THAT, THEREFORE, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE
SPECIFIED IN THIS PART         21,   ADDRESSING SANCTUARY POLICIES AS
OUTLINED IN THIS PART 21 IS A MATTER OF STATEWIDE CONCERN.
(2) THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY FINDS THAT:
(a) ALTHOUGH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS MAINLY A QUESTION OF
FEDERAL LAW, THE EFFECTS AND COST TO TAXPAYERS OF ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION ARE FELT BY PERSONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND IN
COLORADO;
(b) TO   PROTECT THE SECURITY, SAFETY, AND WELL-BEING OF
PERSONS WITHIN THE    UNITED STATES, FEDERAL LAWS PROHIBIT STATE
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM RESTRICTING OR OBSTRUCTING THE
EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION, OR FROM PUNISHING PERSONS FOR
COOPERATING      OR   EXCHANGING         INFORMATION,   WITH   FEDERAL
IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES, AND STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT
VIOLATE SUCH LAWS RISK LOSING FEDERAL GRANTS OR ELIGIBILITY FOR
FEDERAL GRANTS;
(c) THE COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS HAS REPORTED
THAT IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, THE STATE CORRECTIONS SYSTEM RECEIVED
A GRANT FROM THE      UNITED STATES      DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN THE
AMOUNT OF $2,077,720 IN RECOGNITION OF THE COSTS OF INCARCERATING
2,039   CRIMINAL ALIEN INMATES, OR       14.7%   OF ALL DEPARTMENT OF
CORRECTIONS INMATES.      SINCE   THE REPORTED AVERAGE COST PER
OFFENDER WAS $37,958 ANNUALLY IN THE STATE CORRECTIONS SYSTEM
IN 2016, THE TRUE COST OF INCARCERATION FOR 2,039 CRIMINAL ALIEN
INMATES WAS AN ESTIMATED      $77,396,362,       WHICH MEANS THAT THE
FEDERAL GRANT COVERED ONLY         2.7%    OF THE TRUE INCARCERATION
COSTS AND LEAVES      COLORADO    WITH A NET, UNREIMBURSED COST TO
COLORADO TAXPAYERS OF $75,318,642 IN FISCAL YEAR 2016.
(d) FEDERAL    LAW ALSO EXPRESSLY PROHIBITS THE PHYSICAL
HARBORING OF PERSONS KNOWN TO BE UNLAWFULLY PRESENT IN THE
UNITED STATES, SO IT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND CONTRARY TO THE PUBLIC
SAFETY AND WELFARE FOR ANY STATE OR A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO
ENCOURAGE, ENDORSE, OR IN ANY WAY SUPPORT ANY PUBLIC OR PRIVATE
ORGANIZATION SEEKING TO OFFER SO-CALLED "SANCTUARY PROTECTION"
TO PERSONS NOT LAWFULLY PRESENT IN THE UNITED STATES;
(e) AS JUSTICE KENNEDY STATED IN THE MAJORITY OPINION IN
ARIZONA V. UNITED STATES, 567 U.S. 387 (2012), "THE SUPREMACY
CLAUSE   PROVIDES A CLEAR RULE THAT FEDERAL LAW 'SHALL BE THE
SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND'; . . . UNDER THIS PRINCIPLE, CONGRESS HAS
THE POWER TO PREEMPT STATE LAW . . . STATE LAW MUST GIVE WAY TO
FEDERAL LAW IN AT LEAST TWO OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES.           FIRST,   THE
STATES ARE PRECLUDED FROM REGULATING CONDUCT IN A FIELD THAT
CONGRESS . . . HAS DETERMINED MUST BE REGULATED BY ITS EXCLUSIVE
GOVERNANCE       . . . SECOND,   STATE LAWS ARE PREEMPTED WHEN THEY
CONFLICT WITH FEDERAL LAW." [CITATIONS OMITTED].
(f)   IN    STRIKING DOWN THREE      ARIZONA   LAWS CONCERNING
IMMIGRANTS BASED ON FEDERAL SUPREMACY,               JUSTICE KENNEDY
FURTHER FOUND       "THE   FEDERAL POWER TO DETERMINE IMMIGRATION
POLICY IS WELL SETTLED. IMMIGRATION POLICY CAN AFFECT TRADE,
INVESTMENT, TOURISM, AND DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS FOR THE ENTIRE
NATION, AS WELL AS THE PERCEPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS OF ALIENS IN
THIS COUNTRY WHO SEEK THE FULL PROTECTION OF ITS LAWS."
(3) THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, THEREFORE, DECLARES THAT IT IS IN
THE BEST INTERESTS OF      COLORADO TO PROHIBIT ITS STATE AND LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS FROM CREATING OR ENFORCING POLICIES OR ORDINANCES
THAT OBSTRUCT OR RESTRICT COMMUNICATION OR COOPERATION WITH
FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AGENCIES OR PERSONNEL.
